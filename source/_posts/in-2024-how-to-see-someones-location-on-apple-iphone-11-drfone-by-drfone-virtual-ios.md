## Method 3: Disable location tracking of specific apps

In the above section, you have stopped tracking on Apple iPhone 11 entirely which means any of the location based app or service won’t be able to locate you. Nevertheless, completely turning it off can sometimes be useless as there are some apps that need the tracking of your location so as to give you better experience. As a solution for this, you can follow the steps below and can turn off location for specific apps only. Here is how to stop tracking on Apple iPhone 11 for specific apps.

**Step 1:** Open “Settings” as usual firstly and go to “Privacy”.

**Step 2:** Go to “Location Services” and don’t toggle it off. Instead, you will find apps listed under the option.

**Step 3:** Select the apps and make adjustments according to your preferences. You can choose among “Never”, “While Using the App” and “Always”.

![make adjustments](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-specific-apps.jpg)

The first option will never send your location to the apps. Second option will use your location only when you use the particular app. And as it suggests itself, by choosing the “Always” option will always track your location.

## Part 3. Is the Weather App on Apple iPhone 11 Really Helpful?

It’s fair to say that Weather is not a primary iOS application. You can continue with your usual routine even without it. However, we cannot deny the fact that it’s there for a reason.

But one way or another, it’s best to keep Weather up and running on our Apple iPhone 11.
