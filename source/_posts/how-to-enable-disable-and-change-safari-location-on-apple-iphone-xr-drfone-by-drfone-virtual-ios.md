## Part 3: How to Change Home Address in Google Maps on Apple iPhone XR?

While Apple Maps is the native navigation application in Apple iPhone XR, a lot of people also prefer using Google Maps. Already used by over a billion people worldwide, Google Maps is the most popular and reliable navigation app in the world that runs on Android and Apple iPhone XR alike. Though, unlike Apple Maps, Google Maps lets us save our home, work, or any other addresses in the app itself. In this way, you can easily share your address with others and select your home address for commuting. To learn how to change home address on Apple iPhone XR’s Google Maps app, just follow these steps:

Step 1. To start with, just unlock your Apple iPhone XR and launch the Google Maps application on it. Beforehand, make sure that you are connected to a stable internet connection.

Step 2. Once Google Maps is launched, tap on the hamburger icon at the top-left corner to get more options (like your places, timeline, and more). From here, just tap on the “Your Places” feature.

Step 4. Now, all you got to do is tap on the search bar and enter your home address so that Google Maps would automatically load it. You can also tap on the “Choose on Map” field to find the home address easily on Google Maps.
