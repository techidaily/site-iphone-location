If you are not comfortable downloading an extra app on your phone to serve the purpose, the next method that awaits you to fake GPS on the iPad/Apple iPhone 8 is a computer program named Xcode. Here, we are bringing how you can accomplish the faking task with this.

**Step 1: Get the Program Installed and set up a Dummy App**

**Step 2: Proceed to set up GIT on Xcode**

- You will now see a pop-up on the next screen asking “Please tell me who you are”. Also, there will be some GIT commands on the screen that needs to be applied. Now, launch the terminal on your Mac and go along with the commands given below.

    ![launch terminal](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-ios-5.jpg)

1. Git config --global user.email "<you@example.com>"
2. git config --global user. name "your name"

However, this method can give a hard time as it depends on the iOS or Android version you are using. We are introducing ‘The Anywhere!’ app for this purpose and this can work on iOS 17 well. Here is the guide for this. Take the iOS system as an example:

- Download the ‘The Anywhere!’ location faking the Cydia app on your phone.
- Install and launch the app from your Home screen.
- Navigate for the location that you want to fake.
- Tap on it and a red pin will appear on the address.
- Next, tap on the blue tab on the coming screen.
- You can now select the apps on which you wish to fake GPS location on iOS.
- Open the selected app now and you could see the new location on it.
