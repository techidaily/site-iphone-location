## Part 1: Do you know how does these locations work?

While both terms may sound to you similar, there are certain differences between them. Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone 14 or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.

When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 14 device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.

All we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to **change location on Apple iPhone 14**, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.

If you have changed your location or the app misperceives your location, follow these steps and get accurate weather updates:

**3\. Is there a risk of my account being banned in certain apps or games if I change my location?**

Yes, you might encounter issues in certain apps if you change location on your Apple iPhone 14. This is because some apps have terms that prohibit falsifying locations.

## Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 14/iPad?

Pokemon Go players always look forward to cheats and hacks that can help them catch more Pokemon in the game. While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.

One such cheat/hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.

## Part 1: What is Pokego++?

If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.

![pokego++](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg)

PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.

It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 14/iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.

## Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++

So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.

Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 14 or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.
