## Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 6s/iPad?

Pokemon Go players always look forward to cheats and hacks that can help them catch more Pokemon in the game. While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.

One such cheat/hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.

## Part 1: What is Pokego++?

If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.

![pokego++](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg)

PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.

It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 6s/iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.

## Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++

So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.

Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 6s or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.

## Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++

Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks/tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon. So, if PokeGo++ doesn’t work anymore, what’s an alternative that can help you use a fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.

The answer is [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). It’s a dedicated geo-spoofing tool for iOS that comes with a built-in “Teleport Mode” feature. Thanks to this feature, you can change your smartphone’s location to anywhere in the world with a single click.

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also comes with a dedicated GPS Joystick. This means apart from changing your smartphone’s location, you can also fake your movement on the map and virtually collect different Pokemon. One of the best features of Virtual Location is that it lets you customize your movement speed. So, even if you are faking your location in the game, you can stay assured that Niantic won’t ban your account.

Here are a few key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) that makes it the best geo spoofing tool to fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.

- Use Teleport Mode to Choose Any Location Across the Globe
- Use GPS Joystick to virtually collect all your favorite Pokemon GO characters
- Customize the movement speed using a simple slider
- Automatic marching to configure your character to move in one direction automatically
- Control GPS location for up to 5 iOS devices simultaneously

So, if you are also ready to use the best PokeGo++ alternative, here’s the detailed step-by-step process to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

That’s it; when you’ll launch Pokemon Go, you’ll automatically notice different streets. At this point, you can enable “GPS Joystick” and easily control your movement without walking at all.

## Conclusion

Despite being a pretty useful tweaked version of Pokemon Go, PokeGO++ is not available anymore. However, if you still want to catch different types of Pokemon in the game, you can use [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) (iOS) to set a fake GPS location in the game.

![change Apple iPhone 6s location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png)

- The location of your Apple iPhone 6s or Android device should be changed instantly. You can click on the chain icon (the walk mode) on the right pane of the screen. To select Bicycle mode or car mode, click on the subsequent icons.

That's how simple it is to use the [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to simulate fake GPS movement. Retain that this is just an introduction to what the program can do.



### 2\. Mock Locations (fake GPS path)

Mock Location (fake GPS path) works like any other tool mentioned here. It spoofs the location by providing false information via the GPS and network providers. When it comes to functioning, you can use Mock Location (fake GPS path) to spoof your location to any other location in the world.

Like Wondershare's Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, Mock Location allows you to set two points, and it will find the route automatically. You can set breakpoints and move via variable speed at different points marked on the map. Plus, you can choose to move at a pace between 20 - 40kmph. You can use advanced functions like braking before turns. Additionally, you can use joysticks or keyboards to move around in the new location.

![mock location gps path interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/mock-location-fake-gps.jpg)

Overall, with a 4+ rating on the Google Play store, Mock Location (fake GPS path) is a considerable tool for anyone looking for a reliable iTools virtual location alternative. However, it is expensive compared to Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, given it charges you per item ($0.49 - $10.99 per item), and there is no option for a monthly subscription.

**Key Features:**

- You can hide the Mock Location (fake GPS path) icon from the notification bar, allowing you to take screenshots conveniently.
- Set starting and ending points and move between the points automatically.
- Move at different speeds between two points. Automatically slows down the speed at turns or bends.
- You can replay the route from the GPX file.

**Pros:**

- Mock Location (fake GPS path) is a simple-to-use application.
- A lot of advanced features to mock your location like a professional.
- It works on a range of applications, including location-based games.
- You can use joysticks to move manually in the new location.

**Cons:**

- Costly application; you have to purchase maps, routes, and features individually.
- Many applications get crash when you try to change the location.
- Mock Location (fake GPS path) can sometimes be buggy. For instance, when you are on a track, it will show you are driving a car.

### 3\. Fake GPS Location Spoofer

Fake GPS Location Spoofer is another prominent location changer on the Google Play store and a suitable iTools alternative. You can select any area from the world, and the Fake GPS Location Spoofer will spoof your location on most of the applications effectively.

Yes, it works only on some location-based applications. You cannot use Fake GPS Location Spoofer on apps like Pokemon Go. It is also important to note that most users have indicated their accounts have been banned because of using this application.

![fake gps location spoofer interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/mock-location-fake-gps-1.jpg)

However, you can use the Fake GPS Location Spoofer to access restricted websites efficiently. The application is free to use, and you do not have to pay even a dime. Needless to say, it annoys you with tons of ads, so that's a disadvantage.

**Key Features:**

- Stops and gyms. You can stop at a different location for up to an hour and move automatically after the allotted time passes.

### 4\. Lexa's Fake GPS Location

Lexa's Fake GPS Location is pretty much similar to the aforementioned Fake GPS Location Spoofer. It is free, simple to use, and effective on only some location-based applications. Still, useful features like the History allow you to find the previously used routes. Additionally, you can get information about the altitude and the place when you mark it on the map.

![lexa fake gps location spoofer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/mock-location-lexa-fake-gps.jpg)

The best thing about Lexa Fake GPS Location is its simplicity. The sheer straightforwardness of the user interface makes it suitable for non-tech-savvy users looking for a simple means to alter their location. Unlike iTools 4 Virtual Location, you do not need a computer to get the job done.

**Key Features:**

- You can set intervals and multiple stops within a route.
- A range of settings allows you to customize the tool as per need.

You can move to a different location using GPS coordinates or simply searching for the place. You can also set up routes or import readymade routes via GPX files. You can also access the previous routes saved in the Historical records to quickly move to a past route.

![fake gps run](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/fake-gps-run.jpg)

The best thing about Fake GPS Run is its simple-to-use interface. In fact, when you compare the last two iTools alternative to Fake GPS Run, you will find that all three are basically the same applications under different uniforms. But when it comes to uniform the interface, Fake GPS Run wins the contest. Like its earlier two predecessors, it is free but burdens the users with tons of ads.

**Key Features:**

- Fake GPS Run is made explicitly for Samsung users.
- You can enter the location coordinates and locate them accurately.
- You can hide the Fake GPS Run icon from the notification bar.
- It works well on most location-based apps and websites.

**Pros:**

- Completely free to use.

- Choose Toolset. And click on Buy Now to subscribe to one of the plans of the iTools Virtual Location.

### 2\. Is iTools Virtual Location Safe?

Yes. iTools Virtual Location is entirely safe to use. However, you must remember that it is not the nature of the iTools Virtual Location that will cause problems.

However, some applications like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) allow you to change the location on Android 6.0 and later versions conveniently.
