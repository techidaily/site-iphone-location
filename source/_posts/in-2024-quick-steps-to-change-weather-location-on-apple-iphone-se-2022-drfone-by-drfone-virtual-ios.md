You can mimic the cycling, walking, or driving speed on real roads or on a user-** defined route established by choosing two points. To make your movements more natural, you can add relevant pauses along the journey as per your needs.
- **Use Joystick to simulate GPS movement-** the use of Joystick will save up to 90% of the labor involved in GPS movement control. Whichever mode you are in as either one-stop, multi-stop, or teleport mode.
- **Automatic marching-** with one click, you can make GPS spot the move automatically. You can change the directions in real time.
- **Change directions up to 360 degrees-** use the direction arrows to set the desired movement direction.
- **Works with all GPS-** based AR games or apps.
