## Solution 3: Fake iOS or Android GPS by using a computer program

If you are not comfortable downloading an extra app on your phone to serve the purpose, the next method that awaits you to fake GPS on the iPad/Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max is a computer program named Xcode. Here, we are bringing how you can accomplish the faking task with this.

**Step 1: Get the Program Installed and set up a Dummy App**

**Step 2: Proceed to set up GIT on Xcode**

- You will now see a pop-up on the next screen asking “Please tell me who you are”. Also, there will be some GIT commands on the screen that needs to be applied. Now, launch the terminal on your Mac and go along with the commands given below.

    ![launch terminal](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-ios-5.jpg)

1. Git config --global user.email "<you@example.com>"
2. git config --global user. name "your name"

![input commands](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-ios-6.jpg)

**Note:** Make alterations on “<you@example.com>” and “your name” with your information.

**Step 3: Move your Location Head**

Now, go for the “Debug” menu. Followed by this, hit on “Simulate Location” and you can choose the location according to your preference. You are good to go now.

## Solution 4: Fake iOS GPS by jailbreaking your systems

The next method to **fake location on Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max** and Android phones is by jailbreaking your device. When you jailbreak your device, you get the opportunity to make changes to most of the native settings in your device. However, this method can give a hard time as it depends on the iOS or Android version you are using. We are introducing ‘The Anywhere!’ app for this purpose and this can work on iOS 17 well. Here is the guide for this. Take the iOS system as an example:

- Download the ‘The Anywhere!’ location faking the Cydia app on your phone.
- Install and launch the app from your Home screen.
- Navigate for the location that you want to fake.
- Tap on it and a red pin will appear on the address.
- Next, tap on the blue tab on the coming screen.
- You can now select the apps on which you wish to fake GPS location on iOS.
- Open the selected app now and you could see the new location on it.
