Once you have loaded the map on the interface, you can easily save it offline as a GPX file. To do that, just click on the Export icon from the floating menu on the side.

![save one stop route](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/save-one-stop-route.png)

Similarly, you can also import a GPX file directly to the Dr.Fone application. To do this, you just have to click on the “Import” icon from the sidebar. This will open a browser window, letting you go to a location on your computer where the GPX file is saved.

![import gpx file](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/import-gpx.png)

Once the GPX file is loaded, you can simply wait for a while and let the application process it without closing it in between.

![wait import gpx](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/wait-import-gpx.png)

As you can see, it is pretty easy to view GPX online or offline using the right tools. In this post, I have included a detailed guide on how to view GPX in Google Maps. Besides that, I have also included another solution to view GPX on a map using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) (iOS). Apart from importing/exporting GPX files, the application can also be used to spoof your Apple iPhone 14 Plus’s location or simulate its movement virtually from anywhere you want.
