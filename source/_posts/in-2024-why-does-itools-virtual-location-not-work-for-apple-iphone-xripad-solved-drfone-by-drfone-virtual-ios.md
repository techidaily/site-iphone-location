## Solution 2: Spoof Apple iPhone XR location with NordVPN

Jailbreaking could be an easy method but a lot of people avoid it. So, if you wish to **spoof Apple iPhone XR GPS** without jailbreak, choosing this method will be a great idea. Here is how you can do it. Using the app [NordVPN](https://apps.apple.com/app/nordvpn-vpn-fast-secure/id905953485?platform=iphone), you will fake the location on social media thereby showing others that you are on vacation.

- Download and install NordVPN on your Apple iPhone XR.
- Launch NordVPN and sign in to your account.
- Connect to a VPN server in the location you want to appear to be in.
- Open the "Settings" app on your Apple iPhone XR and navigate to "Privacy".
- Tap on "Location Services" and turn it on.
- Scroll down and find the app you want to fake your location for and tap on it.
- Choose "While Using the App" as the location access option.
- Open the app and it will now use the location of the NordVPN server you connected to.

## Solution 3: Fake iOS or Android GPS by using a computer program

If you are not comfortable downloading an extra app on your phone to serve the purpose, the next method that awaits you to fake GPS on the iPad/Apple iPhone XR is a computer program named Xcode. Here, we are bringing how you can accomplish the faking task with this.

**Step 1: Get the Program Installed and set up a Dummy App**

**Step 2: Proceed to set up GIT on Xcode**

- You will now see a pop-up on the next screen asking “Please tell me who you are”. Also, there will be some GIT commands on the screen that needs to be applied. Now, launch the terminal on your Mac and go along with the commands given below.

    ![launch terminal](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-ios-5.jpg)

1. Git config --global user.email "<you@example.com>"
2. git config --global user. name "your name"

## Solution 4: Fake iOS GPS by jailbreaking your systems

The next method to **fake location on Apple iPhone XR** and Android phones is by jailbreaking your device. When you jailbreak your device, you get the opportunity to make changes to most of the native settings in your device. However, this method can give a hard time as it depends on the iOS or Android version you are using. We are introducing ‘The Anywhere!’ app for this purpose and this can work on iOS 17 well. Here is the guide for this. Take the iOS system as an example:

- Download the ‘The Anywhere!’ location faking the Cydia app on your phone.
- Install and launch the app from your Home screen.
- Navigate for the location that you want to fake.
- Tap on it and a red pin will appear on the address.
- Next, tap on the blue tab on the coming screen.
- You can now select the apps on which you wish to fake GPS location on iOS.
- Open the selected app now and you could see the new location on it.
