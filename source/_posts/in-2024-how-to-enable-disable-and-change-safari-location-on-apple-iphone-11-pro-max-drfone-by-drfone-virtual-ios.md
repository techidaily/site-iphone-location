There are several situations when you might have to change the location on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max. Perhaps you are moving to another region, so you have to make changes with your Apple ID to get App Store access.

## Part 1: Do you know how does these locations work?

While both terms may sound to you similar, there are certain differences between them. Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max or Android is a GPS device.

If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.

When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.

All we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to **change location on Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max**, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.
