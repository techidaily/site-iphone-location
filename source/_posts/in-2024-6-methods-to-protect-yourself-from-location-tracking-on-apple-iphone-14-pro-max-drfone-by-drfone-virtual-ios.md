Yes, you might encounter issues in certain apps if you change location on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max. This is because some apps have terms that prohibit falsifying locations. If they observe a rapid change in location due to VPN, it could lead to a ban to maintain fair play. To avoid this issue, always use a legitimate means of updating locations and be familiar with other terms.

**4\. How do I change my location back to my real one?**

If you have faked your location on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max for certain games and applications, check the settings of your location spoofer. Within the app settings, you can revert to your actual location. Apart from that, if you are using a VPN to change location, disconnect from it. Upon turning it off, your device will return to the real location.
