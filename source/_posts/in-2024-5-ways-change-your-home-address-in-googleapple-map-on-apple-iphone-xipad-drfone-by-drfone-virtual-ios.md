In this way, the application can enter your changed address while autofilling a form. Here’s a simple tweak that you can do to change home address in Apple iPhone X autofill.

Step 1. Firstly, you need to follow the above-mentioned drill and go to your own contact card to change your home address.

## Part 3: How to Change Home Address in Google Maps on Apple iPhone X?

While Apple Maps is the native navigation application in Apple iPhone X, a lot of people also prefer using Google Maps. Already used by over a billion people worldwide, Google Maps is the most popular and reliable navigation app in the world that runs on Android and Apple iPhone X alike.

In this way, you can easily share your address with others and select your home address for commuting. To learn how to change home address on Apple iPhone X’s Google Maps app, just follow these steps:

Step 1. To start with, just unlock your Apple iPhone X and launch the Google Maps application on it. Beforehand, make sure that you are connected to a stable internet connection.

Step 2. Once Google Maps is launched, tap on the hamburger icon at the top-left corner to get more options (like your places, timeline, and more). From here, just tap on the “Your Places” feature.
