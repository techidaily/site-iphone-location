## Part 2: How to Change Home Address in Apple iPhone X Autofill?

Sometimes, changing the home address on Apple Maps is not enough. For instance, if you use Safari, then you might be familiar with the autofill feature. While filling a form in Safari, it would automatically detect the fields and will enter the relevant information on its own. Therefore, if you have changed your home address on Maps, then it is recommended to reflect that on Safari as well. In this way, the application can enter your changed address while autofilling a form. Here’s a simple tweak that you can do to change home address in Apple iPhone X autofill.

Step 1. Firstly, you need to follow the above-mentioned drill and go to your own contact card to change your home address.

Step 2. Once you have changed your home address in contacts, just go to your Apple iPhone X’s Settings > Safari and tap on the “Autofill” option under the General section.

Step 3. Here, you can view details related to the automatic filling of contacts, names, passwords, credit cards, etc. Firstly, make sure that the option to autofill contacts info is enabled.

Step 4. Now, tap on the “My Info” option to view your details like name, email, address, and so on. Just go to the “Address” field and manually enter your new address to change it.
