You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.

![pokego++](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg)

They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.

Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well.
