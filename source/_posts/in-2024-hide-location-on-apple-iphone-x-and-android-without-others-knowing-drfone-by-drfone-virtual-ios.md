- **Not working on iOS 17-** As aforementioned, iOS 17 has had issues with iTools. One of the best ways to ensure a smooth click with iTools is to downgrade your iOS 17 to say iOS 16. The temporary solution offered for iOS 17 seems to work on some devices only.
- **Location won't move-** when you change your current location and fail to move on your apps say google maps or Facebook, you will find yourself in fake location. Simply restart your device, and the problem will disappear.
- **Image load failed-** This issue is often related to compatibility issues. Check if you downloaded the program after the forced PoGo updates. You can try downgrading your device if you are doing iOS 17.
