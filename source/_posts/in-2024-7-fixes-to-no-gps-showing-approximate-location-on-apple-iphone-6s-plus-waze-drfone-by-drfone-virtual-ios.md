**Step 4.** Once you go to the new location, you can see the location on your phone has been changed.

![change Apple iPhone 6s Plus location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png)

- The location of your Apple iPhone 6s Plus or Android device should be changed instantly. You can click on the chain icon (the walk mode) on the right pane of the screen. To select Bicycle mode or car mode, click on the subsequent icons.

That's how simple it is to use the [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to simulate fake GPS movement. Retain that this is just an introduction to what the program can do.



### 2\. Mock Locations (fake GPS path)

Mock Location (fake GPS path) works like any other tool mentioned here. It spoofs the location by providing false information via the GPS and network providers. When it comes to functioning, you can use Mock Location (fake GPS path) to spoof your location to any other location in the world.

Like Wondershare's Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, Mock Location allows you to set two points, and it will find the route automatically. You can set breakpoints and move via variable speed at different points marked on the map. Plus, you can choose to move at a pace between 20 - 40kmph. You can use advanced functions like braking before turns. Additionally, you can use joysticks or keyboards to move around in the new location.

![mock location gps path interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/mock-location-fake-gps.jpg)

Overall, with a 4+ rating on the Google Play store, Mock Location (fake GPS path) is a considerable tool for anyone looking for a reliable iTools virtual location alternative. However, it is expensive compared to Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, given it charges you per item ($0.49 - $10.99 per item), and there is no option for a monthly subscription.

**Key Features:**

- You can hide the Mock Location (fake GPS path) icon from the notification bar, allowing you to take screenshots conveniently.
- Set starting and ending points and move between the points automatically.
- Move at different speeds between two points. Automatically slows down the speed at turns or bends.
- You can replay the route from the GPX file.

**Pros:**

- Mock Location (fake GPS path) is a simple-to-use application.
- A lot of advanced features to mock your location like a professional.
- It works on a range of applications, including location-based games.
- You can use joysticks to move manually in the new location.

**Cons:**

- Costly application; you have to purchase maps, routes, and features individually.
- Many applications get crash when you try to change the location.
- Mock Location (fake GPS path) can sometimes be buggy. For instance, when you are on a track, it will show you are driving a car.

### 3\. Fake GPS Location Spoofer

Fake GPS Location Spoofer is another prominent location changer on the Google Play store and a suitable iTools alternative. You can select any area from the world, and the Fake GPS Location Spoofer will spoof your location on most of the applications effectively.

Yes, it works only on some location-based applications. You cannot use Fake GPS Location Spoofer on apps like Pokemon Go. It is also important to note that most users have indicated their accounts have been banned because of using this application.

![fake gps location spoofer interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/mock-location-fake-gps-1.jpg)

However, you can use the Fake GPS Location Spoofer to access restricted websites efficiently. The application is free to use, and you do not have to pay even a dime. Needless to say, it annoys you with tons of ads, so that's a disadvantage.

**Key Features:**

- Stops and gyms. You can stop at a different location for up to an hour and move automatically after the allotted time passes.
- You can use Joystick to move conveniently.
- You can use GPX files to import routes.
- You can create your own routes.

- There is no option to remove the icon from the notification bar.

### 4\. Lexa's Fake GPS Location

Lexa's Fake GPS Location is pretty much similar to the aforementioned Fake GPS Location Spoofer. It is free, simple to use, and effective on only some location-based applications. Still, useful features like the History allow you to find the previously used routes. Additionally, you can get information about the altitude and the place when you mark it on the map.

![lexa fake gps location spoofer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/mock-location-lexa-fake-gps.jpg)

The best thing about Lexa Fake GPS Location is its simplicity. The sheer straightforwardness of the user interface makes it suitable for non-tech-savvy users looking for a simple means to alter their location. Unlike iTools 4 Virtual Location, you do not need a computer to get the job done.

**Key Features:**

- You can set intervals and multiple stops within a route.
- A range of settings allows you to customize the tool as per need.
- Import GPX files and travel on readymade routes.
- You can access the Historical records and move along the past routes conveniently.

**Pros:**

- Entirely free to use; there is no need to sign up.
- You can enter coordinates instead of names to move to a definite location.
- Use joysticks or a keyboard to simulate the fake GPS movement.
- You can use it to access restricted content.

**Cons:**

- Fake GPS Location Spoofer does not work on all location-based applications.
- Tons of ads annoy you during the setup process.
- There is no option to remove the icon from the notification bar.

### 5\. Fake GPS Run

Fake GPS Run is another suitable iTools Virtual Location alternative that gets the job done for the most part and does not charge you even a dime. You can move to a different location using GPS coordinates or simply searching for the place. You can also set up routes or import readymade routes via GPX files. You can also access the previous routes saved in the Historical records to quickly move to a past route.

![fake gps run](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/fake-gps-run.jpg)

The best thing about Fake GPS Run is its simple-to-use interface. In fact, when you compare the last two iTools alternative to Fake GPS Run, you will find that all three are basically the same applications under different uniforms. But when it comes to uniform the interface, Fake GPS Run wins the contest. Like its earlier two predecessors, it is free but burdens the users with tons of ads.

**Key Features:**

- Fake GPS Run is made explicitly for Samsung users.
- You can enter the location coordinates and locate them accurately.
- You can hide the Fake GPS Run icon from the notification bar.
- It works well on most location-based apps and websites.

**Pros:**

- Completely free to use.
- You can access the Historical records and move along the past route.
- You can set stop points in the chosen route.
- Elegant interface.

**Cons:**

- Bugs and issues.
- It does not work well with advanced applications like Pokemon Go.

## Part 6. FAQs About iTools Virtual Location

### 1\. How to Download iTools Virtual Location?

- Go to the Official ThinkSkySoft page.
- Click on Products from the upper-right pane.
- Choose Toolset. And click on Buy Now to subscribe to one of the plans of the iTools Virtual Location.

### 2\. Is iTools Virtual Location Safe?

Yes. iTools Virtual Location is entirely safe to use. However, you must remember that it is not the nature of the iTools Virtual Location that will cause problems. For instance, iTools comes from ThinkSkySoft, which is a reputed brand. Nevertheless, it does not use advanced algorithms to spoof GPS location. As a result, many social applications identify the application and may ban you.

### 3\. Can you change your Android location with iTools?

No. The older versions of Android (Android 5.0 and earlier) allow you to change the GPS location without root. However, the newer versions (Android 6.0 and later) do not allow you to change the location without rooting. iTools Virtual Location cannot help you in this regard.

However, some applications like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) allow you to change the location on Android 6.0 and later versions conveniently.

### Conclusion

iTools Virtual Location, all in all, is a comprehensive program and is equipped with all the necessary tools that one might look for in a GPS spoofing application. It allows you to move automatically, manually, and at different speeds. You can also mark the Pins in a route and make the simulation look genuine. However, the problem forces you to purchase the full Toolset to use the application. You have to pay US$ 59.95 to use one function of the tool. Aside from that, it does not use advanced algorithms, so some apps might crash or not work with iTools Virtual Location.

The first one in the alternative list, the [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) , is the most significant location changer in the market.
