### 3.1 Costly on Comparison

Double Location dongle devices are costly. Because of their high efficiency, the sellers decided to tag them with high prices that might bring a frown on your face.

### 3.2 Slow Delivery

The delivery time is excruciatingly long. It will take a lot of time for them to deliver your piece and if you are expecting it on a particular day, you will certainly be disappointed.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3.3 Website Design

The website layout is a bit confusing. After iTeleporter has combined with Double Location, they made a few modifications to the site. Now it is a tiny bit confusing to navigate through the pages and get to where you want. It could be a little simpler to make life easier.

### 3.4 Helpline Replies

The helpline center’s response is so slow that I sometimes wonder if there is a helpline team. They have their pages on Facebook and Twitter. You can chat with executives on their official websites as well. Though they promise a response within 1 hour, it is not the case most of the time. They do reply but not when you most need it.

![change home address Apple iPhone SE (2020) 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/change-home-address-iphone-1.jpg)

## Part 1: How to Change Home Address in Apple Maps on Apple iPhone SE (2020)

Apple has developed a native navigation application that comes inbuilt in every Apple iPhone SE (2020) model.

To learn how to change home address on Apple iPhone SE (2020) 11, X, XR, 8, and other models, follow these steps:

Step 2. This will list out detailed information about you. You can review the fields and to make any changes, tap on the “Edit” button from the top.

## Part 2: How to Change Home Address in Apple iPhone SE (2020) Autofill?

Sometimes, changing the home address on Apple Maps is not enough. For instance, if you use Safari, then you might be familiar with the autofill feature. While filling a form in Safari, it would automatically detect the fields and will enter the relevant information on its own. Therefore, if you have changed your home address on Maps, then it is recommended to reflect that on Safari as well. In this way, the application can enter your changed address while autofilling a form. Here’s a simple tweak that you can do to change home address in Apple iPhone SE (2020) autofill.

Step 1. Firstly, you need to follow the above-mentioned drill and go to your own contact card to change your home address.

Step 2. Once you have changed your home address in contacts, just go to your Apple iPhone SE (2020)’s Settings > Safari and tap on the “Autofill” option under the General section.

Step 3. Here, you can view details related to the automatic filling of contacts, names, passwords, credit cards, etc. Firstly, make sure that the option to autofill contacts info is enabled.

Step 4. Now, tap on the “My Info” option to view your details like name, email, address, and so on. Just go to the “Address” field and manually enter your new address to change it.

While Apple Maps is the native navigation application in Apple iPhone SE (2020), a lot of people also prefer using Google Maps. Already used by over a billion people worldwide, Google Maps is the most popular and reliable navigation app in the world that runs on Android and Apple iPhone SE (2020) alike. Though, unlike Apple Maps, Google Maps lets us save our home, work, or any other addresses in the app itself. In this way, you can easily share your address with others and select your home address for commuting. To learn how to change home address on Apple iPhone SE (2020)’s Google Maps app, just follow these steps:

Step 1. To start with, just unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2020) and launch the Google Maps application on it. Beforehand, make sure that you are connected to a stable internet connection.

Step 2. Once Google Maps is launched, tap on the hamburger icon at the top-left corner to get more options (like your places, timeline, and more). From here, just tap on the “Your Places” feature.

![change home address Apple iPhone SE (2020) 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/change-home-address-iphone-8.jpg)

Step 3. This will list out all the saved addresses on the screen like your home, work, etc. To add or change your home address, you can just tap on the “Home” field here.

Step 4. Now, all you got to do is tap on the search bar and enter your home address so that Google Maps would automatically load it. You can also tap on the “Choose on Map” field to find the home address easily on Google Maps.

![change home address Apple iPhone SE (2020) 10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/change-home-address-iphone-10.jpg)
