### 1.1 Understanding the "Location Not Available" Error

iPhone returning with the error "Location Not Available" involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device's GPS. "Location Not Available" in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.

When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the "Location Not Available" message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It's important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.

![location not available error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg)

### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Plus Say, "Location Not Available"?

The "Location Not Available" message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:

- **1\. Location Services Disabled**

One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device's location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.

- **2\. Poor or No Internet Connection**

The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone's Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 15 Plus.

- **3\. Incorrect Date and Time Settings**

The “Date & Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device's location settings.

- **4\. Privacy Settings**

Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.

- **5\. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted**

If the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.

- **6\. Problems with Application or Device**

Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.

In conclusion, the "Location Not Available" error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.

### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Plus Say, "No Location Found"?

There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 15 Plus may display the "No Location Found" error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.

- **1\. Location Services Disabled**

One possible reason for the "No Location Found" error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 15 Plus's Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.

- **2\. Location Not Being Shared**

If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they've stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won't be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.

- **3\. Device Ran Out of Battery**

iPhones are Apple iPhone 15 Plus] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 15 Plus needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 15 Plus run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device when it runs out of battery.

- **4\. iCloud Removed from Device**

Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app's functionality. Apple iPhone 15 Plus provides the "Share My Location" option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.

If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 15 Plus are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 15 Plus in your iCloud settings.

- **5\. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection**

Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 15 Plus relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you're in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.

- **6\. Outdated iOS Version**

Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app's location tracking.

- **7\. Find My Not Working Properly**

Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the "No Location Found" error with the Apple iPhone 15 Plus. You won't get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.

Encountering the "No Location Found" error on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus's Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.

## How to Solve These Issues?

With the significant problems mentioned, it's prudent for someone to ask now what the solution is. Of course, these issues are triggered differently, but there are respective common fixes. However, some can successfully fix the problem while other solutions may hit the blank. Let's see some of the probable solutions to the issues mentioned above.

- **Developer mode-** The solution is to check for the iTools updates for your device.
- **Not downloading-** if the program fails to download, check that your device meets the system requirements. Also, make sure your payments are settled and that the internet connection is established.
- **Map crash-** If the map crashes, it might be because of a problem with the google map API or unestablished communication with iTools. If Google Maps fails, click the three horizontal lines located at the right of the menu bar and switch to Mapbox. Also, check that your internet connection is working fine. If not, try to refresh your internet connection and ensure the connection is established.
- **Stop working-** When the iTools Virtual Location stops working, it might be due to unexpected technical issues. Try restarting the program, and if it persists, restart your device.
- **Not working on iOS 17-** As aforementioned, iOS 17 has had issues with iTools. One of the best ways to ensure a smooth click with iTools is to downgrade your iOS 17 to say iOS 16. The temporary solution offered for iOS 17 seems to work on some devices only.
- **Location won't move-** when you change your current location and fail to move on your apps say google maps or Facebook, you will find yourself in fake location. Simply restart your device, and the problem will disappear.
- **Image load failed-** This issue is often related to compatibility issues. Check if you downloaded the program after the forced PoGo updates. You can try downgrading your device if you are doing iOS 17.
