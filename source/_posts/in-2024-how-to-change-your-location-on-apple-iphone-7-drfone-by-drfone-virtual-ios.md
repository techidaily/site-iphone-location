While both terms may sound to you similar, there are certain differences between them. Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone 7 or Android is a GPS device.

When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 7 device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.
