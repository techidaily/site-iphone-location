### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone XS Max Say, "Location Not Available"?

The "Location Not Available" message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:

- **1\. Location Services Disabled**

- **3\. Incorrect Date and Time Settings**

In this case, the Apple iPhone XS Max device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.

- **5\. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted**

If the Apple iPhone XS Max device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information.
