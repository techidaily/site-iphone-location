## Part 1: How to Change Home Address in Apple Maps on Apple iPhone 12 Pro

Apple has developed a native navigation application that comes inbuilt in every Apple iPhone 12 Pro model. A lot of users take the assistance of Apple Maps to navigate, share their location, and do so much more. If you want, you can add or change your home address on Apple Maps and even mark certain locations as favorite. To learn how to change home address on Apple iPhone 12 Pro 11, X, XR, 8, and other models, follow these steps:

Step 1. Since Apple Maps doesn’t have a native option to change home address, you need to make changes to your Contacts card. For this, you can just launch the Contacts app and tap on your own profile from the top.

Step 2. This will list out detailed information about you. You can review the fields and to make any changes, tap on the “Edit” button from the top.

## Part 2: How to Change Home Address in Apple iPhone 12 Pro Autofill?

Sometimes, changing the home address on Apple Maps is not enough. For instance, if you use Safari, then you might be familiar with the autofill feature. While filling a form in Safari, it would automatically detect the fields and will enter the relevant information on its own. Therefore, if you have changed your home address on Maps, then it is recommended to reflect that on Safari as well. In this way, the application can enter your changed address while autofilling a form. Here’s a simple tweak that you can do to change home address in Apple iPhone 12 Pro autofill.

Step 1. Firstly, you need to follow the above-mentioned drill and go to your own contact card to change your home address.

Step 2. Once you have changed your home address in contacts, just go to your Apple iPhone 12 Pro’s Settings > Safari and tap on the “Autofill” option under the General section.

Step 3. Here, you can view details related to the automatic filling of contacts, names, passwords, credit cards, etc. Firstly, make sure that the option to autofill contacts info is enabled.

Step 4. Now, tap on the “My Info” option to view your details like name, email, address, and so on. Just go to the “Address” field and manually enter your new address to change it.

## Part 3: How to Change Home Address in Google Maps on Apple iPhone 12 Pro?

While Apple Maps is the native navigation application in Apple iPhone 12 Pro, a lot of people also prefer using Google Maps. Already used by over a billion people worldwide, Google Maps is the most popular and reliable navigation app in the world that runs on Android and Apple iPhone 12 Pro alike. Though, unlike Apple Maps, Google Maps lets us save our home, work, or any other addresses in the app itself. In this way, you can easily share your address with others and select your home address for commuting. To learn how to change home address on Apple iPhone 12 Pro’s Google Maps app, just follow these steps:

Step 1. To start with, just unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro and launch the Google Maps application on it. Beforehand, make sure that you are connected to a stable internet connection.

Step 2. Once Google Maps is launched, tap on the hamburger icon at the top-left corner to get more options (like your places, timeline, and more). From here, just tap on the “Your Places” feature.

If you want to prank your friends or hide your location from your apps, there are applications and GPS spoof dongles out there in the market that can help you. Double Location Dongle is one such miraculous creation that is capable of locking your location in a place you’ve never been to before.

Not many of us are aware of Spoofing Dongles. These are very useful hardware pieces that look small but hold huge value. These are inserted into your laptop or phone’s charging port and then help you to fake your location. Double location Dongle does this job perfectly. It is conveniently compatible with the Apple devices from iOS9 to the latest iOS 13.

iTeleporter Pro 2.0 is a similar dongle that was very efficient in spoofing an individual’s location. It is now combined with Double Location and both together created three Double Location masterpieces. Apart from the obvious spoofing benefits, these have other benefits too –

### 1.1 Double Location BT 2.0

You don’t have to keep your Apple iPhone 12 Pro’s charging port occupied anymore. You can connect this Dongle to your phone by Bluetooth wirelessly. It is easy to charge this dongle too. It comes with a decent USB plug that you can insert into your Personal computer, Laptop or Desktop for easy charging.

### 1.2 Double Location Mini 2.0

This dongle provides 2 in 1 benefits. On one side, it has the USB plug that will help you connect the dongle to your PC or laptop. While on the other side, you have the lightning port. If you have access to a lightning cable, it is easy to charge the iPhone and iPad with this one.

This square white beauty does a terrific job in hiding your actual location. Also, it is having 3-in-1 benefits where you can connect it to iPhone, iPad and Apple adapters as well. It has a 3.5mm headphone jack and a lightning charge port.

## Part2. Why choose Double Location Dongle?

Choosing Double Location Dongle will be a profit both because of its high functionality and long durability. Moreover, the hardware piece also provides additional benefits apart from the spoofing of location.

![double location dongle pic 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-2.jpg)

### 2.1 iOS System-level location change

It provides iOS system level GPS manipulation that changes your location in all apps and even the ones with Apple protection cannot detect where you are actually seated.

### 2.2 Safety as Priority

This dongle is completely safe and blocks any external interferences that try to capture your data illegally. It shields the bans from the Manufacturer’s (Apple) side. Your data and you are absolutely safe.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2.3 No Jailbreak

Often, you might receive restrictions from the manufacturer during the GPS simulation. In that case, you have to consider jailbreak to get the job done. But Double Location doesn’t require jailbreak and smoothly gets your work done.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part3. Why should you not choose Double Location Dongle?

While you’ve already seen one side of the coin, it is time to see the other one. Yes, there are good benefits to Double Location but I have to mention the cons as well in this double location dongle review.

![double location dongle pic 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-3.jpg)

### 3.1 Costly on Comparison

Double Location dongle devices are costly. Because of their high efficiency, the sellers decided to tag them with high prices that might bring a frown on your face.

### 3.2 Slow Delivery

The delivery time is excruciatingly long. It will take a lot of time for them to deliver your piece and if you are expecting it on a particular day, you will certainly be disappointed.

### 3.3 Website Design

The website layout is a bit confusing. After iTeleporter has combined with Double Location, they made a few modifications to the site. Now it is a tiny bit confusing to navigate through the pages and get to where you want. It could be a little simpler to make life easier.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3.4 Helpline Replies

The helpline center’s response is so slow that I sometimes wonder if there is a helpline team. They have their pages on Facebook and Twitter. You can chat with executives on their official websites as well. Though they promise a response within 1 hour, it is not the case most of the time. They do reply but not when you most need it.

![double location dongle pic 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-8.jpg)

You need to select your location before you enter the game and not after it.

## Part5. Any PC program if Double Location Dongle fails to work?

In case you have no access to Double Location Dongle or it is not working, you can go for other computer spoofing experts like dr. fone and iSpoofer.

iSpoofer is system software that helps in hiding your locations in the games or office devices. You can purchase it as a quarterly plan for household use or as a Monthly plan for an organization with many computer devices. With the motto of ‘Work hard, play smart’, this one keeps you covered for a while.

Dr. fone is similar software that spoofs your location. This is an economical purchase that lets you take the monthly, quarterly and annual plans. All of them cost less than $10!
