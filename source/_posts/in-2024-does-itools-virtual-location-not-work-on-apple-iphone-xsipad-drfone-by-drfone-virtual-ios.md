**1\. How do I [change weather location on Apple iPhone XS](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-location/how-to-change-weather-location-ipad.html)?**

If you have changed your location or the app misperceives your location, follow these steps and get accurate weather updates:

**Instructions:** Go to your iDevice’s weather widget and long-press to choose the “Edit Weather” option. Now, tap “My Location” to check your current location. If it’s wrong and you want to change it, type and select the exact one in the “Search” bar. This way, your weather location will be changed on the weather app on your Apple iPhone XS.

**2\. Will changing my location affect my device’s warranty or performance?**

The device’s warranty generally depends on the product and has nothing to do with moving locations. Yet it’s advisable to check the terms and conditions of the warranty. You can check if those conditions cover your device regardless of location. In short, changing location will not affect your phone, but you should note its local regulations.

**3\. Is there a risk of my account being banned in certain apps or games if I change my location?**

Yes, you might encounter issues in certain apps if you change location on your Apple iPhone XS. This is because some apps have terms that prohibit falsifying locations. If they observe a rapid change in location due to VPN, it could lead to a ban to maintain fair play. To avoid this issue, always use a legitimate means of updating locations and be familiar with other terms.

**4\. How do I change my location back to my real one?**

If you have faked your location on your Apple iPhone XS for certain games and applications, check the settings of your location spoofer. Within the app settings, you can revert to your actual location. Apart from that, if you are using a VPN to change location, disconnect from it. Upon turning it off, your device will return to the real location.
