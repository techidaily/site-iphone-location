## Part 3. User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location

One of the best indicators of an online tool's efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics. We did not thoroughly enjoy using the iTools Virtual Location ourselves. And that is because it does not include advanced features as the iTools Virtual Location alternatives mentioned here. Nevertheless, it is also good to look at other users' feedback, so here are a few reviews from iTools users:

**Sri Viswakarma (Content Manager, Greenland LLC.)**

**Ratings: 4.8/5.**

**"**I recently started using the iTools Virtual Location application, and I am impressed that it delivers on its promise.

It's reliable, and I love how it lets me access location-restricted content. I recommend the iTools Virtual Location to anyone looking to change their GPS location on their Apple iPhone 6s Plus conveniently."

**Kat Napiorkowska (Self-employed)**

**Rating: 2.3/5.**

But I have to say that I am quite disappointed with iTools Virtual Location. I was really excited to try iTools Virtual Location, but I have to say I am quite disappointed with the app. In my opinion, the application's user interface is quite confusing, and I found it difficult to navigate. I also experienced some bugs and crashes while using the app, which was frustrating. The location-changing feature didn't seem to work well for me, as the new location wasn't accurate or consistent. I was hoping for a reliable and efficient tool, but unfortunately, iTools Virtual Location did not meet my expectations. I would not recommend this app to others."
