## How to View GPX Files: Online and Offline Solutions Of Apple iPhone 7

Also known as GPS Exchange Format, GPX is one of the most resourceful file types that is used to store and import/export map-related data. Ideally, a lot of people use GPX files to access a particular route offline when they are off the grid. Though, there are times when users find it hard to view GPX on a map. Don’t worry, there are plenty of ways to view GPX online or offline. In this post, I will let you know how to view GPX in Google Maps and other resourceful desktop applications in detail.

## Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?

Before we discuss how to utilize a GPX view online or offline tool, let’s quickly consider how these files work. It stands for GPS Exchange format and stores map-related data in an XML format. Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.

From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:

- __Coordinates__: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.
- __Routes__: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).
- __Tracks__: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.

![GPX File](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg)

Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.

## Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?

The good thing is that there are tons of options to view GPX online on desktop, Android, or iOS platforms. Some of these freely available solutions to view GPX on Map are Google Earth, Google Maps, Bing Maps, Garmin BaseCamp, GPX Viewer, and so on.

Out of them, Google Maps is one of the most used solutions to view GPX online on smartphones and desktops alike. As of now, you can import GPX files in the KML format or even load CSV files of exact coordinates on Google Maps. To learn how to view GPX in Google Maps, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Go to Your Places in Google Maps**

To view GPX on the map, you can first head to the official website of Google Maps on your computer. Now, just click on the hamburger (three-line) icon from the top-left corner to access its options.
