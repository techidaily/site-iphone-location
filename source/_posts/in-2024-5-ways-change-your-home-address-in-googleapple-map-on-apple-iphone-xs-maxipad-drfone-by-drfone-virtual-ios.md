As your IP is considered as a digital footprint, a VPN enables you to mask your real IP and conceal your identity. It means that absolute online privacy as well as anonymity. VPN connects you to a server of your preference, which enables you to bypass all geo-restrictions for the desired content access. To simply put, a VPN helps you to unblock streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, etc outside your country and content access worldwide.

There are so many options available for VPN out there, so choosing the ideal one is a bit challenging. However, you can pick any popular options that support platform - Apple iPhone XS Max.  You can get ExpressVPN, IPVanish or NordVPN to fake the location on your Apple iPhone XS Max.

**1\. How do I [change weather location on Apple iPhone XS Max](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-location/how-to-change-weather-location-ipad.html)?**

If you have changed your location or the app misperceives your location, follow these steps and get accurate weather updates:

**Instructions:** Go to your iDevice’s weather widget and long-press to choose the “Edit Weather” option. Now, tap “My Location” to check your current location. If it’s wrong and you want to change it, type and select the exact one in the “Search” bar. This way, your weather location will be changed on the weather app on your Apple iPhone XS Max.

Yes, you might encounter issues in certain apps if you change location on your Apple iPhone XS Max. This is because some apps have terms that prohibit falsifying locations.

To avoid this issue, always use a legitimate means of updating locations and be familiar with other terms.

**4\. How do I change my location back to my real one?**
