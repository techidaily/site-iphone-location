## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean in Find My App?

If you are an Apple iPhone 6s Plus user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says "Location Not Available." This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are tracking.

### 1.1 Understanding the "Location Not Available" Error

iPhone returning with the error "Location Not Available" involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device's GPS. "Location Not Available" in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.

When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the "Location Not Available" message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It's important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.

![location not available error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg)

### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Plus Say, "Location Not Available"?

The "Location Not Available" message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:

- **1\. Location Services Disabled**

One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device's location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.

- **2\. Poor or No Internet Connection**

The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone's Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 6s Plus.

- **3\. Incorrect Date and Time Settings**

The “Date & Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device's location settings.

- **4\. Privacy Settings**

Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.

- **5\. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted**

If the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.

- **6\. Problems with Application or Device**

Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.

In conclusion, the "Location Not Available" error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.

Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app's functionality. Apple iPhone 6s Plus provides the "Share My Location" option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.

Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 6s Plus in your iCloud settings.

- **5\. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection**

Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 6s Plus relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you're in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.

- **6\. Outdated iOS Version**

Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app's location tracking.

- **7\. Find My Not Working Properly**

### 2.2 Safety as Priority

This dongle is completely safe and blocks any external interferences that try to capture your data illegally. It shields the bans from the Manufacturer’s (Apple) side. Your data and you are absolutely safe.

### 2.3 No Jailbreak

Often, you might receive restrictions from the manufacturer during the GPS simulation. In that case, you have to consider jailbreak to get the job done. But Double Location doesn’t require jailbreak and smoothly gets your work done.

### 2.4 No need of PC

You don’t need a computer for the Dongle to work. It is easy to attach it to your Apple iPhone 6s Plus or iPad’s charging port and then launch it into action. You can carry it wherever you go.

### 2.5 Works for diverse Apps

You can spoof your location on a wide range of apps like Google Maps, Find My iPhone, Zenly, Pokémon Go, Tinder, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook among more.

## Part3. Why should you not choose Double Location Dongle?

While you’ve already seen one side of the coin, it is time to see the other one. Yes, there are good benefits to Double Location but I have to mention the cons as well in this double location dongle review.

![double location dongle pic 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-3.jpg)

### 3.1 Costly on Comparison

Double Location dongle devices are costly. Because of their high efficiency, the sellers decided to tag them with high prices that might bring a frown on your face.

### 3.2 Slow Delivery

The delivery time is excruciatingly long. It will take a lot of time for them to deliver your piece and if you are expecting it on a particular day, you will certainly be disappointed.

### 3.3 Website Design

The website layout is a bit confusing. After iTeleporter has combined with Double Location, they made a few modifications to the site. Now it is a tiny bit confusing to navigate through the pages and get to where you want. It could be a little simpler to make life easier.

### 3.4 Helpline Replies

The helpline center’s response is so slow that I sometimes wonder if there is a helpline team. They have their pages on Facebook and Twitter. You can chat with executives on their official websites as well. Though they promise a response within 1 hour, it is not the case most of the time. They do reply but not when you most need it.

## Part5. Any PC program if Double Location Dongle fails to work?

In case you have no access to Double Location Dongle or it is not working, you can go for other computer spoofing experts like dr. fone and iSpoofer.
