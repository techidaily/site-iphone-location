## Double Location Dongle: All to Know About Apple iPhone 6s/iPad GPS Spoofing

If you want to prank your friends or hide your location from your apps, there are applications and GPS spoof dongles out there in the market that can help you. Double Location Dongle is one such miraculous creation that is capable of locking your location in a place you’ve never been to before. Now combined with iTeleporter, it works well for a wide range of locations, dating and gaming apps. Let’s go on and see the Double Location Dongle review.

## Part1. About Double Location Dongle

![double location dongle pic 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-1.jpg)

Not many of us are aware of Spoofing Dongles. These are very useful hardware pieces that look small but hold huge value. These are inserted into your laptop or phone’s charging port and then help you to fake your location. Double location Dongle does this job perfectly. It is conveniently compatible with the Apple devices from iOS9 to the latest iOS 13.

iTeleporter Pro 2.0 is a similar dongle that was very efficient in spoofing an individual’s location. It is now combined with Double Location and both together created three Double Location masterpieces. Apart from the obvious spoofing benefits, these have other benefits too –

### 1.1 Double Location BT 2.0

You don’t have to keep your Apple iPhone 6s’s charging port occupied anymore. You can connect this Dongle to your phone by Bluetooth wirelessly. It is easy to charge this dongle too. It comes with a decent USB plug that you can insert into your Personal computer, Laptop or Desktop for easy charging.

### 1.2 Double Location Mini 2.0

This dongle provides 2 in 1 benefits. On one side, it has the USB plug that will help you connect the dongle to your PC or laptop. While on the other side, you have the lightning port. If you have access to a lightning cable, it is easy to charge the iPhone and iPad with this one.

### 1.3 Double Location Pro 2.0

This square white beauty does a terrific job in hiding your actual location. Also, it is having 3-in-1 benefits where you can connect it to iPhone, iPad and Apple adapters as well. It has a 3.5mm headphone jack and a lightning charge port.

## Part2. Why choose Double Location Dongle?

Choosing Double Location Dongle will be a profit both because of its high functionality and long durability. Moreover, the hardware piece also provides additional benefits apart from the spoofing of location.

![double location dongle pic 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-2.jpg)

### 2.1 iOS System-level location change

It provides iOS system level GPS manipulation that changes your location in all apps and even the ones with Apple protection cannot detect where you are actually seated.

### 2.2 Safety as Priority

This dongle is completely safe and blocks any external interferences that try to capture your data illegally. It shields the bans from the Manufacturer’s (Apple) side. Your data and you are absolutely safe.

### 2.3 No Jailbreak

Often, you might receive restrictions from the manufacturer during the GPS simulation. In that case, you have to consider jailbreak to get the job done. But Double Location doesn’t require jailbreak and smoothly gets your work done.

### 2.4 No need of PC

You don’t need a computer for the Dongle to work. It is easy to attach it to your Apple iPhone 6s or iPad’s charging port and then launch it into action. You can carry it wherever you go.

### 2.5 Works for diverse Apps

You can spoof your location on a wide range of apps like Google Maps, Find My iPhone, Zenly, Pokémon Go, Tinder, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook among more.

## Part3. Why should you not choose Double Location Dongle?

While you’ve already seen one side of the coin, it is time to see the other one. Yes, there are good benefits to Double Location but I have to mention the cons as well in this double location dongle review.

![double location dongle pic 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-3.jpg)

### 3.1 Costly on Comparison

Double Location dongle devices are costly. Because of their high efficiency, the sellers decided to tag them with high prices that might bring a frown on your face.

### 3.2 Slow Delivery

The delivery time is excruciatingly long. It will take a lot of time for them to deliver your piece and if you are expecting it on a particular day, you will certainly be disappointed.

### 3.3 Website Design

The website layout is a bit confusing. After iTeleporter has combined with Double Location, they made a few modifications to the site. Now it is a tiny bit confusing to navigate through the pages and get to where you want. It could be a little simpler to make life easier.

### 3.4 Helpline Replies

The helpline center’s response is so slow that I sometimes wonder if there is a helpline team. They have their pages on Facebook and Twitter. You can chat with executives on their official websites as well. Though they promise a response within 1 hour, it is not the case most of the time. They do reply but not when you most need it.

## Part4. How to use Double Location Dongle for Apple iPhone 6s/iPad GPS spoofing

**Step 1.** Connect the Dongle to your desired device

![double location dongle pic 4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-4.jpg)

**Step 2.** Enter the iOS Companion app to activate the benefits. When you purchase your dongle, the sellers will give you access to this link too. This one is required for availing of all benefits.

**Benefit 1:** Using coordinates or specific location, lock your spoof location.

![double location dongle pic 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-8.jpg)

You need to select your location before you enter the game and not after it.

## Part5. Any PC program if Double Location Dongle fails to work?

## How to View GPX Files: Online and Offline Solutions Of Apple iPhone 6s

Also known as GPS Exchange Format, GPX is one of the most resourceful file types that is used to store and import/export map-related data. Ideally, a lot of people use GPX files to access a particular route offline when they are off the grid. Though, there are times when users find it hard to view GPX on a map. Don’t worry, there are plenty of ways to view GPX online or offline. In this post, I will let you know how to view GPX in Google Maps and other resourceful desktop applications in detail.

## Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?

Before we discuss how to utilize a GPX view online or offline tool, let’s quickly consider how these files work. It stands for GPS Exchange format and stores map-related data in an XML format. Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.

From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:

- __Coordinates__: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.
- __Routes__: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).
- __Tracks__: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.

![GPX File](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg)

Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.

## Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?

The good thing is that there are tons of options to view GPX online on desktop, Android, or iOS platforms. Some of these freely available solutions to view GPX on Map are Google Earth, Google Maps, Bing Maps, Garmin BaseCamp, GPX Viewer, and so on.

Out of them, Google Maps is one of the most used solutions to view GPX online on smartphones and desktops alike. As of now, you can import GPX files in the KML format or even load CSV files of exact coordinates on Google Maps. To learn how to view GPX in Google Maps, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Go to Your Places in Google Maps**

To view GPX on the map, you can first head to the official website of Google Maps on your computer. Now, just click on the hamburger (three-line) icon from the top-left corner to access its options.

![Google Maps More Option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-3.jpg)

This will display various options related to your Google Maps account. From here, you can just click on the “Your Places” feature.

![Google Maps Your Places](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-4.jpg)

**Step 2: Choose to Create a New Map**

As a dedicated section of “Your Places” would be launched, you can view all the saved places for your Google Maps account. Here, you can go to the “Maps” tab to view the existing saved route and spots. Since you have to view GPX in Google Maps, you can click on the “Create Map” option from the bottom to load a new map.

![Google Maps Create Map Option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-5.jpg)

**Step 3: Import and View the GPX File Online**

This will make Google Maps load a new page that will let you create a fresh map as per your preferences. Here, you can just click on the “Import” button to load a browser window from where you can directly load a GPX file on Google Maps and make it available offline as well.

## Part 3: How to View a GPX File Offline with Dr.Fone – Virtual Location?

Besides Google Maps, you can also take the assistance of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location to view GPX files on your computers offline. Since it is a desktop tool, it would let you load any GPX file without being connected to an active internet connection.

Therefore, if you want, you can first simulate the movement of your device and export the GPX file. Later, you can import the saved GPX file and simulate your Apple iPhone 6s movement in the same route without any trouble.

**Step 3: Export or Import the GPX Files**

Once you have loaded the map on the interface, you can easily save it offline as a GPX file. To do that, just click on the Export icon from the floating menu on the side.

![save one stop route](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/save-one-stop-route.png)

Similarly, you can also import a GPX file directly to the Dr.Fone application. To do this, you just have to click on the “Import” icon from the sidebar. This will open a browser window, letting you go to a location on your computer where the GPX file is saved.

![import gpx file](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/import-gpx.png)

Once the GPX file is loaded, you can simply wait for a while and let the application process it without closing it in between.

![wait import gpx](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/wait-import-gpx.png)

As you can see, it is pretty easy to view GPX online or offline using the right tools. In this post, I have included a detailed guide on how to view GPX in Google Maps. Besides that, I have also included another solution to view GPX on a map using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) (iOS).
