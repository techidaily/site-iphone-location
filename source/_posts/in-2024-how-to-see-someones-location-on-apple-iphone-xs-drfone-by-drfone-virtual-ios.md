## Part 5: How to use VPN to fake the location?

As your IP is considered as a digital footprint, a VPN enables you to mask your real IP and conceal your identity. It means that absolute online privacy as well as anonymity. VPN connects you to a server of your preference, which enables you to bypass all geo-restrictions for the desired content access. To simply put, a VPN helps you to unblock streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, etc outside your country and content access worldwide.

There are so many options available for VPN out there, so choosing the ideal one is a bit challenging. However, you can pick any popular options that support platform - Apple iPhone XS.  You can get ExpressVPN, IPVanish or NordVPN to fake the location on your Apple iPhone XS.
