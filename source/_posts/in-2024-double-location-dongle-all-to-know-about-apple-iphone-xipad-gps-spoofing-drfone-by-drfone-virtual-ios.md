## Part3. Why should you not choose Double Location Dongle?

### 3.1 Costly on Comparison

Double Location dongle devices are costly. Because of their high efficiency, the sellers decided to tag them with high prices that might bring a frown on your face.

### 3.2 Slow Delivery

The delivery time is excruciatingly long. It will take a lot of time for them to deliver your piece and if you are expecting it on a particular day, you will certainly be disappointed.

### 3.3 Website Design

The website layout is a bit confusing. After iTeleporter has combined with Double Location, they made a few modifications to the site. Now it is a tiny bit confusing to navigate through the pages and get to where you want. It could be a little simpler to make life easier.

### 3.4 Helpline Replies

The helpline center’s response is so slow that I sometimes wonder if there is a helpline team. They have their pages on Facebook and Twitter. You can chat with executives on their official websites as well. Though they promise a response within 1 hour, it is not the case most of the time. They do reply but not when you most need it.

## Part4. How to use Double Location Dongle for Apple iPhone X/iPad GPS spoofing

## Method 2: Disable location tracking of Apple iPhone X completely

If the above method didn’t suit you, this is how you can turn off tracking on Apple iPhone X. Using this method, you will end up deactivating the location services of Apple iPhone X completely. The steps are no rocket science and with just one toggling, you can reach to what you want. By doing this, any app in the Apple iPhone X that uses your location will be of no use. For instance, the maps, Find My Friends and Find My Apple iPhone X apps will not be able to track your location. Also, you will stop anyone from tracking you this way. Here are the steps on how to stop tracking on Apple iPhone X completely:

**Step 1:** Go to the “Settings” in your Apple iPhone X as the initial step. Now, look for “Privacy” option and tap on it.

![disable location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-completely-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, go for the “Location Services” and tap on it.

## Method 3: Disable location tracking of specific apps

In the above section, you have stopped tracking on Apple iPhone X entirely which means any of the location based app or service won’t be able to locate you. Nevertheless, completely turning it off can sometimes be useless as there are some apps that need the tracking of your location so as to give you better experience. As a solution for this, you can follow the steps below and can turn off location for specific apps only. Here is how to stop tracking on Apple iPhone X for specific apps.

**Step 1:** Open “Settings” as usual firstly and go to “Privacy”.

**Step 2:** Go to “Location Services” and don’t toggle it off. Instead, you will find apps listed under the option.

**Step 3:** Select the apps and make adjustments according to your preferences. You can choose among “Never”, “While Using the App” and “Always”.

![make adjustments](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-specific-apps.jpg)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

The first option will never send your location to the apps. Second option will use your location only when you use the particular app. And as it suggests itself, by choosing the “Always” option will always track your location.

## Method 4: Disable Significant Locations on Apple iPhone X

Apart from the apps, Apple iPhone X itself keeps record of where you travel the most. These frequently visited locations are referred to as significant locations. The purpose of such tracking is to help you providing location concerned suggestions, especially when you employ Siri or other features. If you want to turn off such tracking on Apple iPhone X, we can help you. These are the steps that you should follow in this case.

**Step 1:** From your Apple iPhone X’s Home screen, go to the “Settings” app.

**Step 2:** Select the “Privacy” option now and head to the “Location Services” located at the top of the screen.

**Step 3:** After this, click on the “System Services” from the bottom.

![Significant Locations](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-significant-locations-2.jpg)

They can get to know your current location through apps like Find My Friends if this feature is turned on.
