## Conclusion

Thus, concealing the location details of your device protects you from unwanted cyber issues. Instead of turning on and off the iOS Safari location services, you can straightaway modify it into a fake zone. This approach would greatly help when you install any apps or enter into websites at this online platform. You can make use of the cyberspace efficiently if you make such modification in your Apple iPhone 11. Choose [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to make desired changes in your default location of your Apple iPhone 11.
