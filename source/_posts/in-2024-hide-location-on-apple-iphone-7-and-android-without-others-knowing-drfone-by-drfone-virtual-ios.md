Step 1. Firstly, you need to follow the above-mentioned drill and go to your own contact card to change your home address.

Step 3. Here, you can view details related to the automatic filling of contacts, names, passwords, credit cards, etc. Firstly, make sure that the option to autofill contacts info is enabled.
