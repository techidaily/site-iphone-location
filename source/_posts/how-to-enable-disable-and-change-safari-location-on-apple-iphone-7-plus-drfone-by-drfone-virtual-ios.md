### 3.1 Costly on Comparison

Double Location dongle devices are costly. Because of their high efficiency, the sellers decided to tag them with high prices that might bring a frown on your face.

### 3.2 Slow Delivery

The delivery time is excruciatingly long. It will take a lot of time for them to deliver your piece and if you are expecting it on a particular day, you will certainly be disappointed.

### 3.3 Website Design

The website layout is a bit confusing. After iTeleporter has combined with Double Location, they made a few modifications to the site. Now it is a tiny bit confusing to navigate through the pages and get to where you want. It could be a little simpler to make life easier.

### 3.4 Helpline Replies

The helpline center’s response is so slow that I sometimes wonder if there is a helpline team. They have their pages on Facebook and Twitter. You can chat with executives on their official websites as well. Though they promise a response within 1 hour, it is not the case most of the time. They do reply but not when you most need it.

## Part 2: How to Change Your Home Address in Apple Maps on iPhone

Unlike Google Maps, Apple Map doesn't allow you to change the home address directly in the app, nor does it automatically detect your new home location. To update your home address, you need to change it in your contact card saved on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus.

Here’s how to update your home address in Apple Maps via contact card:

- **Step1:** Open the “Favorites” section in Apple maps and swipe it up.
