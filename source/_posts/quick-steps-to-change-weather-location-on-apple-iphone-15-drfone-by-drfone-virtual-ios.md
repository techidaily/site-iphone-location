## Method 2: Disable location tracking of Apple iPhone 15 completely

If the above method didn’t suit you, this is how you can turn off tracking on Apple iPhone 15. Using this method, you will end up deactivating the location services of Apple iPhone 15 completely. The steps are no rocket science and with just one toggling, you can reach to what you want. By doing this, any app in the Apple iPhone 15 that uses your location will be of no use. For instance, the maps, Find My Friends and Find My Apple iPhone 15 apps will not be able to track your location. Also, you will stop anyone from tracking you this way. Here are the steps on how to stop tracking on Apple iPhone 15 completely:

**Step 1:** Go to the “Settings” in your Apple iPhone 15 as the initial step. Now, look for “Privacy” option and tap on it.

![disable location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-completely-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, go for the “Location Services” and tap on it.

## Method 3: Disable location tracking of specific apps

In the above section, you have stopped tracking on Apple iPhone 15 entirely which means any of the location based app or service won’t be able to locate you. Nevertheless, completely turning it off can sometimes be useless as there are some apps that need the tracking of your location so as to give you better experience. As a solution for this, you can follow the steps below and can turn off location for specific apps only. Here is how to stop tracking on Apple iPhone 15 for specific apps.

**Step 1:** Open “Settings” as usual firstly and go to “Privacy”.

**Step 2:** Go to “Location Services” and don’t toggle it off. Instead, you will find apps listed under the option.

**Step 3:** Select the apps and make adjustments according to your preferences. You can choose among “Never”, “While Using the App” and “Always”.

![make adjustments](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-specific-apps.jpg)

The first option will never send your location to the apps. Second option will use your location only when you use the particular app. And as it suggests itself, by choosing the “Always” option will always track your location.

## Method 4: Disable Significant Locations on Apple iPhone 15

Apart from the apps, Apple iPhone 15 itself keeps record of where you travel the most. These frequently visited locations are referred to as significant locations. The purpose of such tracking is to help you providing location concerned suggestions, especially when you employ Siri or other features. If you want to turn off such tracking on Apple iPhone 15, we can help you. These are the steps that you should follow in this case.

**Step 1:** From your Apple iPhone 15’s Home screen, go to the “Settings” app.

**Step 2:** Select the “Privacy” option now and head to the “Location Services” located at the top of the screen.

**Step 3:** After this, click on the “System Services” from the bottom.

![System Services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-significant-locations-1.jpg)

**Step 4:** Look for “Significant Locations”. You will be prompted to use your password or touch ID to access the feature. Do it right away.

**Step 5:** Toggle off the green slider near “Significant Locations”. This is it!

## Method 5: Disable Share My Location service

The feature “Share My Locations” enables you to share your locations with your family and friends. They can get to know your current location through apps like Find My Friends if this feature is turned on. So, if your concern is “how to stop my parents from tracking my Apple iPhone 15”, you can turn this off. The steps are mentioned below. Follow them and stop worrying if someone is tracking you or not.

**Step 1:** Open “Settings” in your Apple iPhone 15 and go to “Privacy” option.

**Step 2:** Look for the “Share My Location” and toggle it off.

## Method 6: Disable location-based notifications or alerts

iPhone provides three kinds of location based services. These include the services regarding alerts, Apple ads and suggestions. If this feature is turned on, you may get the notifications, suggestions or iAds according to what is best for your location. If this bothers you and you don’t want this to happen, you can turn it off by following steps below. This is how to turn off tracking on Apple iPhone 15 in terms of location-based alerts and notifications:

**Step 1:** Launch “Settings” firstly on your device and scroll for “Privacy”.

**Step 2:** Head to the “Location Services” followed by “System Services”.
