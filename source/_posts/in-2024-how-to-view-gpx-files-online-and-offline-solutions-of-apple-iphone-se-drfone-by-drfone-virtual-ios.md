## How to View GPX Files: Online and Offline Solutions Of Apple iPhone SE

Also known as GPS Exchange Format, GPX is one of the most resourceful file types that is used to store and import/export map-related data. Ideally, a lot of people use GPX files to access a particular route offline when they are off the grid. Though, there are times when users find it hard to view GPX on a map. Don’t worry, there are plenty of ways to view GPX online or offline. In this post, I will let you know how to view GPX in Google Maps and other resourceful desktop applications in detail.

## Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?

Before we discuss how to utilize a GPX view online or offline tool, let’s quickly consider how these files work. It stands for GPS Exchange format and stores map-related data in an XML format. Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.

From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:

- __Coordinates__: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.
- __Routes__: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).
- __Tracks__: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.

![GPX File](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg)

Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.

## Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?

The good thing is that there are tons of options to view GPX online on desktop, Android, or iOS platforms. Some of these freely available solutions to view GPX on Map are Google Earth, Google Maps, Bing Maps, Garmin BaseCamp, GPX Viewer, and so on.

Out of them, Google Maps is one of the most used solutions to view GPX online on smartphones and desktops alike. As of now, you can import GPX files in the KML format or even load CSV files of exact coordinates on Google Maps. To learn how to view GPX in Google Maps, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Go to Your Places in Google Maps**

To view GPX on the map, you can first head to the official website of Google Maps on your computer. Now, just click on the hamburger (three-line) icon from the top-left corner to access its options.

![Google Maps More Option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-3.jpg)

## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean in Find My App?

If you are an Apple iPhone SE user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says "Location Not Available." This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone SE device you are tracking.

### 1.1 Understanding the "Location Not Available" Error

iPhone returning with the error "Location Not Available" involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone SE device's GPS. "Location Not Available" in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone SE device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.

When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the "Location Not Available" message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone SE device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It's important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone SE device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.

### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE Say, "Location Not Available"?

The "Location Not Available" message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:

- **1\. Location Services Disabled**

One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone SE device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone SE device's location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone SE device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.

- **2\. Poor or No Internet Connection**

The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone SE device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone SE device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone's Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone SE.

- **3\. Incorrect Date and Time Settings**

The “Date & Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone SE are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone SE has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone SE device's location settings.

- **4\. Privacy Settings**

Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone SE device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.

- **5\. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted**

If the Apple iPhone SE device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone SE device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.

- **6\. Problems with Application or Device**

Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone SE device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone SE, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.

In conclusion, the "Location Not Available" error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.

## Part 2: What Does "No Location Found" Mean in Find My App?

The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone SE, iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device. However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.

### 2.1 Understanding the "No Location Found" Error

The "No Location Found" error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone SE is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone SE, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you're trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.

![no location found error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg)

### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE Say, "No Location Found"?

There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone SE may display the "No Location Found" error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.

- **1\. Location Services Disabled**

One possible reason for the "No Location Found" error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone SE's Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.

- **2\. Location Not Being Shared**

If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they've stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won't be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.

- **3\. Device Ran Out of Battery**

iPhones are Apple iPhone SE] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone SE needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone SE run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone SE device when it runs out of battery.

- **4\. iCloud Removed from Device**

Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app's functionality. Apple iPhone SE provides the "Share My Location" option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.

If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone SE are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone SE device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone SE device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone SE in your iCloud settings.

- **5\. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection**

Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone SE relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you're in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.

- **6\. Outdated iOS Version**

Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone SE is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app's location tracking.

- **7\. Find My Not Working Properly**

Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the "No Location Found" error with the Apple iPhone SE. You won't get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.

Encountering the "No Location Found" error on your Apple iPhone SE's Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.

## Part 3: "No Location Found" vs. "Location Not Available" in Find My App

The "No Location Found" and "Location Not Available" errors have a very thin line of difference among them. While both errors involve the inaccessibility of the location services, some causes also display similarities among them. However, there still is a difference in the errors, which is marked by the following table. With the presented distinctions, you can specify the **difference between "No Location Found" and "Location Not Available."**

Before you lead to perform any other action across your Apple iPhone SE, it is highly possible that the problem lies across the Apple Servers. If the service is not operational, you will find a red or yellow dot across it. Find My can be down, which is why all location errors occur across your Apple iPhone SE. For that, you have to wait for a while before the service starts running again.

It is not vital to go for complicated procedures from the very start to resolve the problems of "No Location Found Apple iPhone SE". You can seek the resolution of this problem across the network settings of your Apple iPhone SE. First, if you've connected your Apple iPhone SE to a Wi-Fi network, you can shift to the cellular data network or another Wi-Fi network.

### Fix 5: Try Restarting Your Apple iPhone SE

If the location errors are not resolving under any defined solution, you might have to restart your Apple iPhone SE. This fixes all the prevailing glitches within the Apple iPhone SE device, and it would be best to restart your device. However, the steps for restarting the Apple iPhone SE differ depending on your model. Let's look into the instructions to understand the prevailing differences:

**For Apple iPhone SE with Home Button**

**Step 1:** To turn off an Apple iPhone SE with the Home button, you have to hold the "Power" button on the side.

**Step 2:** This opens a new screen where you have to turn off the Apple iPhone SE with the slider. As it turns off, use the Power button to start the Apple iPhone SE again.

![turn off Apple iPhone SE with the home button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-12.jpg)

**Step 2:** Once you turn off the Apple iPhone SE, you need to wait a few seconds and start the Apple iPhone SE by holding the Power button for a few seconds.

### Fix 6: Enable Location Services From Apple iPhone SE Settings

**'Does "No Location Found" mean they stopped sharing'** might be the question you would seek when you constantly are facing issues with finding a location across the Find My app. This is quite possible as the Location Services across the Apple iPhone SE might be turned off for no particular reason. To resolve this problem, you have to follow the resolution to this problem with the following steps:

**Step 1:** Launch the "Settings" application on the Apple iPhone SE and proceed into the "Privacy & Security" settings available in the list.

![choose privacy and security option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-13.jpg)

**Step 2:** As you lead into the next screen, find "Location Services" among the options. On accessing the "Location Services" settings, ensure that the toggle adjacent to the "Location Services" option is turned on.

### Fix 7: Turning On Precise Location on Apple iPhone SE

As location issues across the Apple iPhone SE involve the location settings, you can also look into the "Precise Location" option for resolving the prevailing problems of the Apple iPhone SE. To execute this properly and avoid all pertinent issues that are preventing you from getting a proper location across Find My, you must follow the steps to turn on Precise Location on your Apple iPhone SE:

**Step 1:** You must open the "Settings" of your Apple iPhone SE and search for the "Privacy & Security" option within the menu. Next, redirect to the "Location Services" section and turn it on with the available toggle.

![select the privacy and security option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-15.jpg)

**Step 2:** Following this, you need to scroll down in the same section and look for "Find My" in the options. As you proceed next, you must confirm that the blue tick is across the "Ask Time or When I Share" or "While Using the App" option. Next, ensure that the toggle of "Precise Location" is turned on.

## Part2. Why choose Double Location Dongle?

Choosing Double Location Dongle will be a profit both because of its high functionality and long durability. Moreover, the hardware piece also provides additional benefits apart from the spoofing of location.

### 2.1 iOS System-level location change

It provides iOS system level GPS manipulation that changes your location in all apps and even the ones with Apple protection cannot detect where you are actually seated.

### 2.2 Safety as Priority

This dongle is completely safe and blocks any external interferences that try to capture your data illegally. It shields the bans from the Manufacturer’s (Apple) side. Your data and you are absolutely safe.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2.3 No Jailbreak

Often, you might receive restrictions from the manufacturer during the GPS simulation. In that case, you have to consider jailbreak to get the job done. But Double Location doesn’t require jailbreak and smoothly gets your work done.

### 2.4 No need of PC

You don’t need a computer for the Dongle to work. It is easy to attach it to your Apple iPhone SE or iPad’s charging port and then launch it into action. You can carry it wherever you go.

### 2.5 Works for diverse Apps

You can spoof your location on a wide range of apps like Google Maps, Find My iPhone, Zenly, Pokémon Go, Tinder, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook among more.

## Part3. Why should you not choose Double Location Dongle?

While you’ve already seen one side of the coin, it is time to see the other one. Yes, there are good benefits to Double Location but I have to mention the cons as well in this double location dongle review.

![double location dongle pic 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-3.jpg)

### 3.1 Costly on Comparison

Double Location dongle devices are costly. Because of their high efficiency, the sellers decided to tag them with high prices that might bring a frown on your face.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3.2 Slow Delivery

The delivery time is excruciatingly long. It will take a lot of time for them to deliver your piece and if you are expecting it on a particular day, you will certainly be disappointed.

### 3.3 Website Design

The website layout is a bit confusing. After iTeleporter has combined with Double Location, they made a few modifications to the site. Now it is a tiny bit confusing to navigate through the pages and get to where you want. It could be a little simpler to make life easier.

### 3.4 Helpline Replies

The helpline center’s response is so slow that I sometimes wonder if there is a helpline team. They have their pages on Facebook and Twitter. You can chat with executives on their official websites as well. Though they promise a response within 1 hour, it is not the case most of the time. They do reply but not when you most need it.

## Part4. How to use Double Location Dongle for Apple iPhone SE/iPad GPS spoofing

**Step 1.** Connect the Dongle to your desired device

![double location dongle pic 4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-4.jpg)

**Step 2.** Enter the iOS Companion app to activate the benefits. When you purchase your dongle, the sellers will give you access to this link too. This one is required for availing of all benefits.

**Benefit 1:** Using coordinates or specific location, lock your spoof location.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Benefit 2:** Create a virtual illusion like you are riding a bike or driving a car in your new location.

![double location dongle pic 6](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-6.jpg)

**Benefit 3:** Gives access to in-game controls where you can tilt your phone and move your game character.

![double location dongle pic 7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-7.jpg)

**Benefit 4:** Use another android or iPhone device as a joystick to control your character in the game.

![double location dongle pic 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-8.jpg)

You need to select your location before you enter the game and not after it.

## Part5. Any PC program if Double Location Dongle fails to work?

In case you have no access to Double Location Dongle or it is not working, you can go for other computer spoofing experts like dr. fone and iSpoofer.

iSpoofer is system software that helps in hiding your locations in the games or office devices. You can purchase it as a quarterly plan for household use or as a Monthly plan for an organization with many computer devices. With the motto of ‘Work hard, play smart’, this one keeps you covered for a while.

Dr. fone is similar software that spoofs your location. This is an economical purchase that lets you take the monthly, quarterly and annual plans. All of them cost less than $10!
