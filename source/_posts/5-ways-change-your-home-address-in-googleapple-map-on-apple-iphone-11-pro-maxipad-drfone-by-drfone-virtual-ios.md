## Part3. Why should you not choose Double Location Dongle?

![double location dongle pic 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-3.jpg)

### 3.1 Costly on Comparison

Double Location dongle devices are costly. Because of their high efficiency, the sellers decided to tag them with high prices that might bring a frown on your face.

### 3.2 Slow Delivery

The delivery time is excruciatingly long. It will take a lot of time for them to deliver your piece and if you are expecting it on a particular day, you will certainly be disappointed.

### 3.3 Website Design

The website layout is a bit confusing. After iTeleporter has combined with Double Location, they made a few modifications to the site. Now it is a tiny bit confusing to navigate through the pages and get to where you want. It could be a little simpler to make life easier.

### 3.4 Helpline Replies

The helpline center‚Äôs response is so slow that I sometimes wonder if there is a helpline team. They have their pages on Facebook and Twitter. You can chat with executives on their official websites as well. Though they promise a response within 1 hour, it is not the case most of the time. They do reply but not when you most need it.
