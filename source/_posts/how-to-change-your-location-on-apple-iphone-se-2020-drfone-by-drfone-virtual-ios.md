## How to Change Your Location on Apple iPhone SE (2020)

There are several situations when you might have to change the location on your Apple iPhone SE (2020). Perhaps you are moving to another region, so you have to make changes with your Apple ID to get App Store access.

## Part 1: Do you know how does these locations work?

While both terms may sound to you similar, there are certain differences between them. Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone SE (2020) or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.

When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.

All we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to **change location on Apple iPhone SE (2020)**, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.

## Solution 2: Spoof Apple iPhone SE (2020) location with NordVPN

Jailbreaking could be an easy method but a lot of people avoid it. So, if you wish to **spoof Apple iPhone SE (2020) GPS** without jailbreak, choosing this method will be a great idea. Here is how you can do it. Using the app [NordVPN](https://apps.apple.com/app/nordvpn-vpn-fast-secure/id905953485?platform=iphone), you will fake the location on social media thereby showing others that you are on vacation.

- Download and install NordVPN on your Apple iPhone SE (2020).
- Launch NordVPN and sign in to your account.
- Connect to a VPN server in the location you want to appear to be in.
- Open the "Settings" app on your Apple iPhone SE (2020) and navigate to "Privacy".
- Tap on "Location Services" and turn it on.
- Scroll down and find the app you want to fake your location for and tap on it.
- Choose "While Using the App" as the location access option.
- Open the app and it will now use the location of the NordVPN server you connected to.

## Solution 3: Fake iOS or Android GPS by using a computer program

If you are not comfortable downloading an extra app on your phone to serve the purpose, the next method that awaits you to fake GPS on the iPad/Apple iPhone SE (2020) is a computer program named Xcode. Here, we are bringing how you can accomplish the faking task with this.

**Step 1: Get the Program Installed and set up a Dummy App**

**Step 2: Proceed to set up GIT on Xcode**

- You will now see a pop-up on the next screen asking “Please tell me who you are”. Also, there will be some GIT commands on the screen that needs to be applied. Now, launch the terminal on your Mac and go along with the commands given below.

    ![launch terminal](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-ios-5.jpg)

1. Git config --global user.email "<you@example.com>"
2. git config --global user. name "your name"

![input commands](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-ios-6.jpg)

**Note:** Make alterations on “<you@example.com>” and “your name” with your information.

**Step 3: Move your Location Head**

Now, go for the “Debug” menu. Followed by this, hit on “Simulate Location” and you can choose the location according to your preference. You are good to go now.

## Solution 4: Fake iOS GPS by jailbreaking your systems

The next method to **fake location on Apple iPhone SE (2020)** and Android phones is by jailbreaking your device. When you jailbreak your device, you get the opportunity to make changes to most of the native settings in your device. However, this method can give a hard time as it depends on the iOS or Android version you are using. We are introducing ‘The Anywhere!’ app for this purpose and this can work on iOS 17 well. Here is the guide for this. Take the iOS system as an example:

- Download the ‘The Anywhere!’ location faking the Cydia app on your phone.
- Install and launch the app from your Home screen.
- Navigate for the location that you want to fake.
- Tap on it and a red pin will appear on the address.
- Next, tap on the blue tab on the coming screen.
- You can now select the apps on which you wish to fake GPS location on iOS.
- Open the selected app now and you could see the new location on it.
