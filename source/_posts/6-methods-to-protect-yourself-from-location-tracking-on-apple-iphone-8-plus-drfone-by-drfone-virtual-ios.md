## Method 3: Disable location tracking of specific apps

In the above section, you have stopped tracking on Apple iPhone 8 Plus entirely which means any of the location based app or service won’t be able to locate you. Nevertheless, completely turning it off can sometimes be useless as there are some apps that need the tracking of your location so as to give you better experience. As a solution for this, you can follow the steps below and can turn off location for specific apps only. Here is how to stop tracking on Apple iPhone 8 Plus for specific apps.

**Step 1:** Open “Settings” as usual firstly and go to “Privacy”.

**Step 2:** Go to “Location Services” and don’t toggle it off. Instead, you will find apps listed under the option.

**Step 3:** Select the apps and make adjustments according to your preferences. You can choose among “Never”, “While Using the App” and “Always”.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![make adjustments](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-specific-apps.jpg)
