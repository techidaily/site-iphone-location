## Part 2: How to Find Someone’s Location on Apple iPhone 6 via Find My Friends

[Find My Friends](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/find-my-friends/id466122094) is another helpful app through which you can track someone’s location easily. Your friends and family members can share their location through this app, and they can also start following your location simultaneously. Moreover, you can set location-based alarms in case you have to pick up someone from the school or airport.

![find my friends ios app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/see-someones-location-iphone-6.jpg)

Through this particular app, you can also try **how to find someone’s location on Apple iPhone 6** efficiently. First, however, you should be remindful of the following two factors before locating someone’s location on Apple iPhone 6 through this app:

- The suitable users for locating someone’s location on Apple iPhone 6 are those who have an evident reach to the target’s iPhone and are also included in the contact list of that particular phone.
- Through this app, you cannot observe someone's location in an incognito mode as the target iPhone owner can easily check if someone is navigating their location once they open the Find My Friends app. Also, a notification will pop up on the target's iPhone regarding their shared location.

### Steps on How to Track Someone’s iPhone via Find My Friends

**Step 1:** Install the "Find My Friends" app on the target's iPhone to start. Remember that the "Find My Friends" app is only available on iOS 12 or below. IOS 13 users need to install the "Find My" app to proceed.
