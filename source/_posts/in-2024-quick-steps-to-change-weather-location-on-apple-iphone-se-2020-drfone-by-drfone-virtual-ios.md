Mock Location (fake GPS path) works like any other tool mentioned here. It spoofs the location by providing false information via the GPS and network providers. When it comes to functioning, you can use Mock Location (fake GPS path) to spoof your location to any other location in the world.

Like Wondershare's Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, Mock Location allows you to set two points, and it will find the route automatically. You can set breakpoints and move via variable speed at different points marked on the map. Plus, you can choose to move at a pace between 20 - 40kmph. You can use advanced functions like braking before turns. Additionally, you can use joysticks or keyboards to move around in the new location.

![mock location gps path interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/mock-location-fake-gps.jpg)

Overall, with a 4+ rating on the Google Play store, Mock Location (fake GPS path) is a considerable tool for anyone looking for a reliable iTools virtual location alternative.

**Key Features:**

### 3\. Fake GPS Location Spoofer

Fake GPS Location Spoofer is another prominent location changer on the Google Play store and a suitable iTools alternative. You can select any area from the world, and the Fake GPS Location Spoofer will spoof your location on most of the applications effectively.

Yes, it works only on some location-based applications. You cannot use Fake GPS Location Spoofer on apps like Pokemon Go. It is also important to note that most users have indicated their accounts have been banned because of using this application.

![fake gps location spoofer interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/mock-location-fake-gps-1.jpg)

![fake gps run](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/fake-gps-run.jpg)

- Choose Toolset. And click on Buy Now to subscribe to one of the plans of the iTools Virtual Location.

### 2\. Is iTools Virtual Location Safe?

Yes. iTools Virtual Location is entirely safe to use. However, you must remember that it is not the nature of the iTools Virtual Location that will cause problems.

However, the problem forces you to purchase the full Toolset to use the application. You have to pay US$ 59.95 to use one function of the tool.
