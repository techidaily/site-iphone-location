**Step 2: Simulate the Movement of your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max**

The application would automatically detect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max on the interface with its present location. To simulate its movement, you can click on the Multi-stop or One-stop Mode icons from the top.

You can now drop the pin in a route on the map and click on the “Move Here” Button to start simulating the movement.

Subsequently, you can select the number of times you want to cover the route and click on the “March” button. The application will even let you select a preferred speed for the movement.

**Step 3: Export or Import the GPX Files**

Once you have loaded the map on the interface, you can easily save it offline as a GPX file. To do that, just click on the Export icon from the floating menu on the side.

Similarly, you can also import a GPX file directly to the Dr.Fone application. To do this, you just have to click on the “Import” icon from the sidebar. This will open a browser window, letting you go to a location on your computer where the GPX file is saved.

Once the GPX file is loaded, you can simply wait for a while and let the application process it without closing it in between.

As you can see, it is pretty easy to view GPX online or offline using the right tools. In this post, I have included a detailed guide on how to view GPX in Google Maps. Besides that, I have also included another solution to view GPX on a map using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) (iOS). Apart from importing/exporting GPX files, the application can also be used to spoof your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max’s location or simulate its movement virtually from anywhere you want.
