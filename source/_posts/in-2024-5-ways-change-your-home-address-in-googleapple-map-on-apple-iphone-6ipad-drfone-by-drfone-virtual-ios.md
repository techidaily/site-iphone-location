**Kat Napiorkowska (Self-employed)**

**Rating: 2.3/5.**

But I have to say that I am quite disappointed with iTools Virtual Location. I was really excited to try iTools Virtual Location, but I have to say I am quite disappointed with the app. In my opinion, the application's user interface is quite confusing, and I found it difficult to navigate.

I was hoping for a reliable and efficient tool, but unfortunately, iTools Virtual Location did not meet my expectations. I would not recommend this app to others."

Overall, with a 4+ rating on the Google Play store, Mock Location (fake GPS path) is a considerable tool for anyone looking for a reliable iTools virtual location alternative.
