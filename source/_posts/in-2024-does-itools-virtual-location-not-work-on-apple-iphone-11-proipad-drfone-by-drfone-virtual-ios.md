## Part 1. Is it Necessary to Hide Your Location on Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro?

First and foremost, most of the apps and services we use today rely heavily on location services. One of which is the Maps app. If we decide to deactivate the location settings on our Apple iPhone 11 Pro, Maps cannot provide us with accurate directions. The same thing goes for ride-hailing applications. We cannot book a ride if our Apple iPhone 11 Pros fail to detect our current location. Simply put, location services are very essential nowadays. Shutting it down will certainly affect our overall mobile experience. That’s why you should think twice before you consider cutting off the location services on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro. If you’re worried about your privacy, maybe you can just hide your real location and nominate a different one. Is it possible? Of course, it is.
