## Part 1. Is it Necessary to Hide Your Location on Your Apple iPhone XR?

First and foremost, most of the apps and services we use today rely heavily on location services.

Shutting it down will certainly affect our overall mobile experience. That’s why you should think twice before you consider cutting off the location services on your Apple iPhone XR. If you’re worried about your privacy, maybe you can just hide your real location and nominate a different one. Is it possible? Of course, it is.
