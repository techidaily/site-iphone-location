## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean in Find My App?

If you are an Apple iPhone 15 Plus user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says "Location Not Available."

### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Plus Say, "Location Not Available"?

In this case, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.

- **5\. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted**

If the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information.

- **6\. Outdated iOS Version**
