## Part 1: Why Waze shows “No GPS - Showing approximate location” on Apple iPhone 11

Fixing the issue can be put as secondary thing. What should matter is why such thing happens. Here are some of the causes or reasons that can lead to Apple iPhone 11 no GPS showing approximate location issue. Please read them.

### 2\. Mock Locations (fake GPS path)

Mock Location (fake GPS path) works like any other tool mentioned here. It spoofs the location by providing false information via the GPS and network providers. When it comes to functioning, you can use Mock Location (fake GPS path) to spoof your location to any other location in the world.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
The best thing about Fake GPS Run is its simple-to-use interface. In fact, when you compare the last two iTools alternative to Fake GPS Run, you will find that all three are basically the same applications under different uniforms.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Is iTools Virtual Location Safe?

Yes. iTools Virtual Location is entirely safe to use. However, you must remember that it is not the nature of the iTools Virtual Location that will cause problems. For instance, iTools comes from ThinkSkySoft, which is a reputed brand. Nevertheless, it does not use advanced algorithms to spoof GPS location. As a result, many social applications identify the application and may ban you.

### 3\. Can you change your Android location with iTools?

No. The older versions of Android (Android 5.0 and earlier) allow you to change the GPS location without root. However, the newer versions (Android 6.0 and later) do not allow you to change the location without rooting. iTools Virtual Location cannot help you in this regard.

However, some applications like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) allow you to change the location on Android 6.0 and later versions conveniently.

### Conclusion

iTools Virtual Location, all in all, is a comprehensive program and is equipped with all the necessary tools that one might look for in a GPS spoofing application. It allows you to move automatically, manually, and at different speeds. You can also mark the Pins in a route and make the simulation look genuine. However, the problem forces you to purchase the full Toolset to use the application. You have to pay US$ 59.95 to use one function of the tool.

The first one in the alternative list, the [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) , is the most significant location changer in the market. It costs nearly 5x lower than iTools Virtual Location and offers more features. Plus, it is more sophisticated and simple to use compared to iTools.
