I was really excited to try iTools Virtual Location, but I have to say I am quite disappointed with the app. In my opinion, the application's user interface is quite confusing, and I found it difficult to navigate.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Method 3: Disable location tracking of specific apps

In the above section, you have stopped tracking on Apple iPhone 15 Pro entirely which means any of the location based app or service won’t be able to locate you. Nevertheless, completely turning it off can sometimes be useless as there are some apps that need the tracking of your location so as to give you better experience. As a solution for this, you can follow the steps below and can turn off location for specific apps only. Here is how to stop tracking on Apple iPhone 15 Pro for specific apps.

**Step 1:** Open “Settings” as usual firstly and go to “Privacy”.

**Step 2:** Go to “Location Services” and don’t toggle it off. Instead, you will find apps listed under the option.

![make adjustments](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-specific-apps.jpg)

The first option will never send your location to the apps. Second option will use your location only when you use the particular app. And as it suggests itself, by choosing the “Always” option will always track your location.

## Method 4: Disable Significant Locations on Apple iPhone 15 Pro
