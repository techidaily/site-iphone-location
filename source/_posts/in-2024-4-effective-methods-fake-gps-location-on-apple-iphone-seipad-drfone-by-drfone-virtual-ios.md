Through this detailed guide, you can quickly learn **how to quickly see someone’s location on Apple iPhone SE**. For diversity, we have discussed three reliable apps that can help you navigate someone's location accurately. However, if you want to fake your location to prevent others from tracking you, we have recommended Dr.Fone – Virtual Location tool, which works precisely in this scenario.

## How to Change Your Location on Apple iPhone SE

There are several situations when you might have to change the location on your Apple iPhone SE. Perhaps you are moving to another region, so you have to make changes with your Apple ID to get App Store access. Or it could be the case that you want to change your region to access a certain application. Whatever your reason is to change your location on the Apple iPhone SE, you have come to the right place. In this post, we have discussed everything you should know about to **spoof location on Apple iPhone SE**.

_**Tips:** Experience the freedom to teleport anywhere with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location! The Fake GPS feature for Apple iPhone SE allows you to break geo limitations and explore the world from your device. Try it now!_

## Part 1: Do you know how does these locations work?

While both terms may sound to you similar, there are certain differences between them. Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone SE or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.

When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone SE device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.

All we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to **change location on Apple iPhone SE**, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.
