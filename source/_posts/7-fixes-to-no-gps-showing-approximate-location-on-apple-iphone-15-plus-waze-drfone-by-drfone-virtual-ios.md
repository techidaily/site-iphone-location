## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean in Find My App?

### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Plus Say, "Location Not Available"?

In this case, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.

- **5\. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted**

If the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information.
