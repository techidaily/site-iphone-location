## Double Location Dongle: All to Know About Apple iPhone 14/iPad GPS Spoofing

If you want to prank your friends or hide your location from your apps, there are applications and GPS spoof dongles out there in the market that can help you. Double Location Dongle is one such miraculous creation that is capable of locking your location in a place you’ve never been to before. Now combined with iTeleporter, it works well for a wide range of locations, dating and gaming apps. Let’s go on and see the Double Location Dongle review.

## Part1. About Double Location Dongle

![double location dongle pic 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-1.jpg)

Not many of us are aware of Spoofing Dongles. These are very useful hardware pieces that look small but hold huge value. These are inserted into your laptop or phone’s charging port and then help you to fake your location. Double location Dongle does this job perfectly. It is conveniently compatible with the Apple devices from iOS9 to the latest iOS 13.

iTeleporter Pro 2.0 is a similar dongle that was very efficient in spoofing an individual’s location. It is now combined with Double Location and both together created three Double Location masterpieces. Apart from the obvious spoofing benefits, these have other benefits too –

### 1.1 Double Location BT 2.0

You don’t have to keep your Apple iPhone 14’s charging port occupied anymore. You can connect this Dongle to your phone by Bluetooth wirelessly. It is easy to charge this dongle too. It comes with a decent USB plug that you can insert into your Personal computer, Laptop or Desktop for easy charging.

### 1.2 Double Location Mini 2.0

This dongle provides 2 in 1 benefits. On one side, it has the USB plug that will help you connect the dongle to your PC or laptop. While on the other side, you have the lightning port. If you have access to a lightning cable, it is easy to charge the iPhone and iPad with this one.

### 1.3 Double Location Pro 2.0

This square white beauty does a terrific job in hiding your actual location. Also, it is having 3-in-1 benefits where you can connect it to iPhone, iPad and Apple adapters as well. It has a 3.5mm headphone jack and a lightning charge port.

## Part2. Why choose Double Location Dongle?

Choosing Double Location Dongle will be a profit both because of its high functionality and long durability. Moreover, the hardware piece also provides additional benefits apart from the spoofing of location.

![double location dongle pic 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-2.jpg)

### 2.1 iOS System-level location change

It provides iOS system level GPS manipulation that changes your location in all apps and even the ones with Apple protection cannot detect where you are actually seated.

### 2.2 Safety as Priority

This dongle is completely safe and blocks any external interferences that try to capture your data illegally. It shields the bans from the Manufacturer’s (Apple) side. Your data and you are absolutely safe.

### 2.3 No Jailbreak

Often, you might receive restrictions from the manufacturer during the GPS simulation. In that case, you have to consider jailbreak to get the job done. But Double Location doesn’t require jailbreak and smoothly gets your work done.

### 2.4 No need of PC

You don’t need a computer for the Dongle to work. It is easy to attach it to your Apple iPhone 14 or iPad’s charging port and then launch it into action. You can carry it wherever you go.

### 2.5 Works for diverse Apps

You can spoof your location on a wide range of apps like Google Maps, Find My iPhone, Zenly, Pokémon Go, Tinder, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook among more.

## Part3. Why should you not choose Double Location Dongle?

While you’ve already seen one side of the coin, it is time to see the other one. Yes, there are good benefits to Double Location but I have to mention the cons as well in this double location dongle review.

![double location dongle pic 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-3.jpg)

### 3.1 Costly on Comparison

Double Location dongle devices are costly. Because of their high efficiency, the sellers decided to tag them with high prices that might bring a frown on your face.

### 3.2 Slow Delivery

The delivery time is excruciatingly long. It will take a lot of time for them to deliver your piece and if you are expecting it on a particular day, you will certainly be disappointed.

### 3.3 Website Design

The website layout is a bit confusing. After iTeleporter has combined with Double Location, they made a few modifications to the site. Now it is a tiny bit confusing to navigate through the pages and get to where you want. It could be a little simpler to make life easier.

### 3.4 Helpline Replies

The helpline center’s response is so slow that I sometimes wonder if there is a helpline team. They have their pages on Facebook and Twitter. You can chat with executives on their official websites as well. Though they promise a response within 1 hour, it is not the case most of the time. They do reply but not when you most need it.

## Part4. How to use Double Location Dongle for Apple iPhone 14/iPad GPS spoofing

**Step 1.** Connect the Dongle to your desired device

![double location dongle pic 4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-4.jpg)

**Step 2.** Enter the iOS Companion app to activate the benefits. When you purchase your dongle, the sellers will give you access to this link too. This one is required for availing of all benefits.

**Benefit 1:** Using coordinates or specific location, lock your spoof location.

## Part5. Any PC program if Double Location Dongle fails to work?

In case you have no access to Double Location Dongle or it is not working, you can go for other computer spoofing experts like dr. fone and iSpoofer.

## Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 14/iPad?

Pokemon Go players always look forward to cheats and hacks that can help them catch more Pokemon in the game. While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.

One such cheat/hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.

## Part 1: What is Pokego++?

If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.

![pokego++](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg)

PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.

It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 14/iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.

## Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++

So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.

Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 14 or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.

## Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++

Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks/tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon. So, if PokeGo++ doesn’t work anymore, what’s an alternative that can help you use a fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also comes with a dedicated GPS Joystick. This means apart from changing your smartphone’s location, you can also fake your movement on the map and virtually collect different Pokemon. One of the best features of Virtual Location is that it lets you customize your movement speed. So, even if you are faking your location in the game, you can stay assured that Niantic won’t ban your account.
