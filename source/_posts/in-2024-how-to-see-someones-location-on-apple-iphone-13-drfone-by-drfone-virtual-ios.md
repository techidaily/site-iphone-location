## Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 13/iPad?

Pokemon Go players always look forward to cheats and hacks that can help them catch more Pokemon in the game. While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.

One such cheat/hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.

## Part 1: What is Pokego++?

If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.

![pokego++](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg)

PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.

It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 13/iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.

## Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++

So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.

Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 13 or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.

## Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++

Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks/tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon. So, if PokeGo++ doesn’t work anymore, what’s an alternative that can help you use a fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.

The answer is [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). It’s a dedicated geo-spoofing tool for iOS that comes with a built-in “Teleport Mode” feature. Thanks to this feature, you can change your smartphone’s location to anywhere in the world with a single click.

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also comes with a dedicated GPS Joystick. This means apart from changing your smartphone’s location, you can also fake your movement on the map and virtually collect different Pokemon. One of the best features of Virtual Location is that it lets you customize your movement speed. So, even if you are faking your location in the game, you can stay assured that Niantic won’t ban your account.

Here are a few key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) that makes it the best geo spoofing tool to fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.

- Use Teleport Mode to Choose Any Location Across the Globe
- Use GPS Joystick to virtually collect all your favorite Pokemon GO characters
- Customize the movement speed using a simple slider
- Automatic marching to configure your character to move in one direction automatically
- Control GPS location for up to 5 iOS devices simultaneously

So, if you are also ready to use the best PokeGo++ alternative, here’s the detailed step-by-step process to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

That’s it; when you’ll launch Pokemon Go, you’ll automatically notice different streets. At this point, you can enable “GPS Joystick” and easily control your movement without walking at all.

## Conclusion

Despite being a pretty useful tweaked version of Pokemon Go, PokeGO++ is not available anymore. However, if you still want to catch different types of Pokemon in the game, you can use [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) (iOS) to set a fake GPS location in the game.

## Part 3. User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location

One of the best indicators of an online tool's efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics. We did not thoroughly enjoy using the iTools Virtual Location ourselves. And that is because it does not include advanced features as the iTools Virtual Location alternatives mentioned here. Nevertheless, it is also good to look at other users' feedback, so here are a few reviews from iTools users:

**Sri Viswakarma (Content Manager, Greenland LLC.)**

**Ratings: 4.8/5.**

**"**I recently started using the iTools Virtual Location application, and I am impressed that it delivers on its promise. The price is quite high compared to other GPS location changes in the market, but during the Trial version of the tool, iTool's simple interface stuck with me. It's reliable, and I love how it lets me access location-restricted content. I recommend the iTools Virtual Location to anyone looking to change their GPS location on their Apple iPhone 13 conveniently."

**Kat Napiorkowska (Self-employed)**

**Rating: 2.3/5.**

But I have to say that I am quite disappointed with iTools Virtual Location. I was really excited to try iTools Virtual Location, but I have to say I am quite disappointed with the app. In my opinion, the application's user interface is quite confusing, and I found it difficult to navigate. I also experienced some bugs and crashes while using the app, which was frustrating. The location-changing feature didn't seem to work well for me, as the new location wasn't accurate or consistent. I was hoping for a reliable and efficient tool, but unfortunately, iTools Virtual Location did not meet my expectations. I would not recommend this app to others."

### 2\. Is iTools Virtual Location Safe?

Yes. iTools Virtual Location is entirely safe to use. However, you must remember that it is not the nature of the iTools Virtual Location that will cause problems. For instance, iTools comes from ThinkSkySoft, which is a reputed brand. Nevertheless, it does not use advanced algorithms to spoof GPS location. As a result, many social applications identify the application and may ban you.

### 3\. Can you change your Android location with iTools?

No. The older versions of Android (Android 5.0 and earlier) allow you to change the GPS location without root. However, the newer versions (Android 6.0 and later) do not allow you to change the location without rooting. iTools Virtual Location cannot help you in this regard.

However, some applications like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) allow you to change the location on Android 6.0 and later versions conveniently.

### Conclusion

iTools Virtual Location, all in all, is a comprehensive program and is equipped with all the necessary tools that one might look for in a GPS spoofing application. It allows you to move automatically, manually, and at different speeds. You can also mark the Pins in a route and make the simulation look genuine. However, the problem forces you to purchase the full Toolset to use the application. You have to pay US$ 59.95 to use one function of the tool. Aside from that, it does not use advanced algorithms, so some apps might crash or not work with iTools Virtual Location.

And that's why we include the five best iTools Virtual Location alternatives. You can choose any of the five as they have nearly the features that iTools Virtual Location does. The first one in the alternative list, the [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) , is the most significant location changer in the market. It costs nearly 5x lower than iTools Virtual Location and offers more features. Plus, it is more sophisticated and simple to use compared to iTools.
