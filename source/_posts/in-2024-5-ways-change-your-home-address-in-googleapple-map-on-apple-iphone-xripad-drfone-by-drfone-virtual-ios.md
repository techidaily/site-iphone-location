## Method 3: Disable location tracking of specific apps

In the above section, you have stopped tracking on Apple iPhone XR entirely which means any of the location based app or service won’t be able to locate you. Nevertheless, completely turning it off can sometimes be useless as there are some apps that need the tracking of your location so as to give you better experience. As a solution for this, you can follow the steps below and can turn off location for specific apps only. Here is how to stop tracking on Apple iPhone XR for specific apps.

**Step 1:** Open “Settings” as usual firstly and go to “Privacy”.

**Step 2:** Go to “Location Services” and don’t toggle it off. Instead, you will find apps listed under the option.

**Step 3:** Select the apps and make adjustments according to your preferences. You can choose among “Never”, “While Using the App” and “Always”.

![make adjustments](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-specific-apps.jpg)

The first option will never send your location to the apps. Second option will use your location only when you use the particular app. And as it suggests itself, by choosing the “Always” option will always track your location.

## Method 4: Disable Significant Locations on Apple iPhone XR

Apart from the apps, Apple iPhone XR itself keeps record of where you travel the most. These frequently visited locations are referred to as significant locations. The purpose of such tracking is to help you providing location concerned suggestions, especially when you employ Siri or other features. If you want to turn off such tracking on Apple iPhone XR, we can help you. These are the steps that you should follow in this case.

**Step 1:** From your Apple iPhone XR’s Home screen, go to the “Settings” app.

**Step 2:** Select the “Privacy” option now and head to the “Location Services” located at the top of the screen.

**Step 3:** After this, click on the “System Services” from the bottom.

**Step 4:** Look for “Significant Locations”. You will be prompted to use your password or touch ID to access the feature. Do it right away.

**Step 5:** Toggle off the green slider near “Significant Locations”. This is it!

If this bothers you and you don’t want this to happen, you can turn it off by following steps below. This is how to turn off tracking on Apple iPhone XR in terms of location-based alerts and notifications:

**Step 1:** Launch “Settings” firstly on your device and scroll for “Privacy”.

**Step 2:** Head to the “Location Services” followed by “System Services”.
