## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean in Find My App?

If you are an Apple iPhone 14 Pro user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says "Location Not Available." This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are tracking.

### 1.1 Understanding the "Location Not Available" Error

iPhone returning with the error "Location Not Available" involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device's GPS. "Location Not Available" in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.

When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the "Location Not Available" message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It's important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.

### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Say, "Location Not Available"?

The "Location Not Available" message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:

- **1\. Location Services Disabled**

One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device's location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.

- **2\. Poor or No Internet Connection**

The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone's Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 14 Pro.

- **3\. Incorrect Date and Time Settings**

The “Date & Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device's location settings.

- **4\. Privacy Settings**

Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.

- **5\. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted**

If the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.

- **6\. Problems with Application or Device**

Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.

In conclusion, the "Location Not Available" error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.

## Part 2: What Does "No Location Found" Mean in Find My App?

The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, iPad, or other Apple devices.

### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Say, "No Location Found"?

There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 14 Pro may display the "No Location Found" error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.

- **1\. Location Services Disabled**

One possible reason for the "No Location Found" error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 14 Pro's Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.

- **2\. Location Not Being Shared**

If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they've stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won't be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.

- **3\. Device Ran Out of Battery**

iPhones are Apple iPhone 14 Pro] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 14 Pro needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 14 Pro run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device when it runs out of battery.

- **4\. iCloud Removed from Device**

Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app's functionality. Apple iPhone 14 Pro provides the "Share My Location" option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.

If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 14 Pro are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 14 Pro in your iCloud settings.

- **5\. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection**

Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you're in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.

- **6\. Outdated iOS Version**

Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app's location tracking.

- **7\. Find My Not Working Properly**

Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the "No Location Found" error with the Apple iPhone 14 Pro. You won't get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.

Encountering the "No Location Found" error on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro's Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.

## Part 3: "No Location Found" vs. "Location Not Available" in Find My App

As a solution for this, you can follow the steps below and can turn off location for specific apps only. Here is how to stop tracking on Apple iPhone 14 Pro for specific apps.

**Step 1:** Open “Settings” as usual firstly and go to “Privacy”.

**Step 2:** Go to “Location Services” and don’t toggle it off. Instead, you will find apps listed under the option.

**Step 3:** Select the apps and make adjustments according to your preferences. You can choose among “Never”, “While Using the App” and “Always”.
