## Part 1: What is Pokego++?

If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know.

![pokego++](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg)

PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.

It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 6 Plus/iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.

## Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++

So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.

Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 6 Plus or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.

## Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++

Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks/tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon. So, if PokeGo++ doesn’t work anymore, what’s an alternative that can help you use a fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.

## Solution 4: Fake iOS GPS by jailbreaking your systems

The next method to **fake location on Apple iPhone 6 Plus** and Android phones is by jailbreaking your device. When you jailbreak your device, you get the opportunity to make changes to most of the native settings in your device. However, this method can give a hard time as it depends on the iOS or Android version you are using. We are introducing ‘The Anywhere!’ app for this purpose and this can work on iOS 17 well. Here is the guide for this. Take the iOS system as an example:

- Download the ‘The Anywhere!’ location faking the Cydia app on your phone.
- Install and launch the app from your Home screen.
- Navigate for the location that you want to fake.
- Tap on it and a red pin will appear on the address.
- Next, tap on the blue tab on the coming screen.
- You can now select the apps on which you wish to fake GPS location on iOS.
