### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 13 mini Say, "Location Not Available"?

- **5\. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted**

### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 13 mini Say, "No Location Found"?

There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 13 mini may display the "No Location Found" error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.

- **1\. Location Services Disabled**

One possible reason for the "No Location Found" error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 13 mini's Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.

- **2\. Location Not Being Shared**

If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they've stopped sharing the location at any time.

- **3\. Device Ran Out of Battery**

iPhones are Apple iPhone 13 mini] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 13 mini needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 13 mini run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched.

- **4\. iCloud Removed from Device**

Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app's functionality. Apple iPhone 13 mini provides the "Share My Location" option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.
