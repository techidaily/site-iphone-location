## Part 3: How to Change Home Address in Google Maps on Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max?

While Apple Maps is the native navigation application in Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, a lot of people also prefer using Google Maps. Already used by over a billion people worldwide, Google Maps is the most popular and reliable navigation app in the world that runs on Android and Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max alike. Though, unlike Apple Maps, Google Maps lets us save our home, work, or any other addresses in the app itself. In this way, you can easily share your address with others and select your home address for commuting. To learn how to change home address on Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max’s Google Maps app, just follow these steps:

Step 1. To start with, just unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max and launch the Google Maps application on it. Beforehand, make sure that you are connected to a stable internet connection.

Step 2. Once Google Maps is launched, tap on the hamburger icon at the top-left corner to get more options (like your places, timeline, and more). From here, just tap on the “Your Places” feature.

Step 3. This will list out all the saved addresses on the screen like your home, work, etc. To add or change your home address, you can just tap on the “Home” field here.

Step 4. Now, all you got to do is tap on the search bar and enter your home address so that Google Maps would automatically load it. You can also tap on the “Choose on Map” field to find the home address easily on Google Maps.

Step 5. That’s it! You can now save the changes you have made and review them whenever you want. To make any changes to it, you can just tap on the three-dot icon adjacent to the Home button. This will let you edit your home address, remove it, and add directions.
