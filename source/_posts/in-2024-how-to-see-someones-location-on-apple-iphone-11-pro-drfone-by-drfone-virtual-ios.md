You can use advanced functions like braking before turns. Additionally, you can use joysticks or keyboards to move around in the new location.

Overall, with a 4+ rating on the Google Play store, Mock Location (fake GPS path) is a considerable tool for anyone looking for a reliable iTools virtual location alternative.

**Key Features:**

The best thing about Fake GPS Run is its simple-to-use interface. In fact, when you compare the last two iTools alternative to Fake GPS Run, you will find that all three are basically the same applications under different uniforms.
