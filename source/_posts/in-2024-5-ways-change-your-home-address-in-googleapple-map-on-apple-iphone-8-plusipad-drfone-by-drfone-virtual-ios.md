### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 8 Plus Say, "Location Not Available"?

- **5\. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted**

If the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information.

Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.

- **2\. Location Not Being Shared**

If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they've stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won't be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.

- **3\. Device Ran Out of Battery**

iPhones are Apple iPhone 8 Plus] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 8 Plus needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 8 Plus run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device when it runs out of battery.

- **4\. iCloud Removed from Device**

Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app's functionality. Apple iPhone 8 Plus provides the "Share My Location" option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.

If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 8 Plus are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 8 Plus in your iCloud settings.

- **5\. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection**

Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 8 Plus relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you're in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.

- **6\. Outdated iOS Version**

Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 8 Plus is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app's location tracking.

- **7\. Find My Not Working Properly**

Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the "No Location Found" error with the Apple iPhone 8 Plus. You won't get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.

Encountering the "No Location Found" error on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus's Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.
