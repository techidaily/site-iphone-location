## Part 2: How to Change Your Home Address in Apple Maps on iPhone

Unlike Google Maps, Apple Map doesn't allow you to change the home address directly in the app, nor does it automatically detect your new home location. To update your home address, you need to change it in your contact card saved on your Apple iPhone XS Max.

Here’s how to update your home address in Apple Maps via contact card:

- **Step1:** Open the “Favorites” section in Apple maps and swipe it up.
