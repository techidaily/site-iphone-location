## Part 3. User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location

One of the best indicators of an online tool's efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics. We did not thoroughly enjoy using the iTools Virtual Location ourselves.

VPN connects you to a server of your preference, which enables you to bypass all geo-restrictions for the desired content access. To simply put, a VPN helps you to unblock streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, etc outside your country and content access worldwide.

There are so many options available for VPN out there, so choosing the ideal one is a bit challenging. However, you can pick any popular options that support platform - Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max.  You can get ExpressVPN, IPVanish or NordVPN to fake the location on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max.

Here’s a quick guide on how to use VPN to fake or change location on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max:

(We have taken NordVPN as an example)

Step 1: Register with NordVPN by going to its official website.

Step 3: Run the app and sign-in with your login details.

Step 4: Click on Quick Connect and give permissions the app asked to connect to the VPN. In a while, you’ll view a map that shows various servers worldwide.

Step 5: To change location, select the ‘Map /List” view - you can click on the country or region you want to set. For instance, swipe across the map until you see the UK. Then, you need to click on the server icon in the mid of that region to connect to the UK region.

## FAQs You May Want to Know

**1\. How do I [change weather location on Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-location/how-to-change-weather-location-ipad.html)?**

If you have changed your location or the app misperceives your location, follow these steps and get accurate weather updates:

**Instructions:** Go to your iDevice’s weather widget and long-press to choose the “Edit Weather” option. Now, tap “My Location” to check your current location. If it’s wrong and you want to change it, type and select the exact one in the “Search” bar. This way, your weather location will be changed on the weather app on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max.

**2\. Will changing my location affect my device’s warranty or performance?**

The device’s warranty generally depends on the product and has nothing to do with moving locations. Yet it’s advisable to check the terms and conditions of the warranty. You can check if those conditions cover your device regardless of location. In short, changing location will not affect your phone, but you should note its local regulations.

**3\. Is there a risk of my account being banned in certain apps or games if I change my location?**

Yes, you might encounter issues in certain apps if you change location on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max. This is because some apps have terms that prohibit falsifying locations. If they observe a rapid change in location due to VPN, it could lead to a ban to maintain fair play. To avoid this issue, always use a legitimate means of updating locations and be familiar with other terms.

**4\. How do I change my location back to my real one?**

If you have faked your location on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max for certain games and applications, check the settings of your location spoofer. Within the app settings, you can revert to your actual location. Apart from that, if you are using a VPN to change location, disconnect from it. Upon turning it off, your device will return to the real location.
