## Part 3. Is the Weather App on Apple iPhone 12 Pro Really Helpful?

All we know for now is that the Weather app helps us stay updated with the latest meteorological forecast. But we don’t know what’s waiting ahead. Maybe the Weather app would soon become a paramount component of an upcoming iOS feature. Is it possible to happen in the future? We’re not sure yet. But one way or another, it’s best to keep Weather up and running on our Apple iPhone 12 Pro.
