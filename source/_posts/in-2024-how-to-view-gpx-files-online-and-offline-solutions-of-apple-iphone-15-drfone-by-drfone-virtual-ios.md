## Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?

Before we discuss how to utilize a GPX view online or offline tool, let’s quickly consider how these files work. It stands for GPS Exchange format and stores map-related data in an XML format. Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.

From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:

- __Coordinates__: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.
- __Routes__: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).
- __Tracks__: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.

![GPX File](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg)

Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.

## Method 2: Disable location tracking of Apple iPhone 15 completely

If the above method didn’t suit you, this is how you can turn off tracking on Apple iPhone 15. Using this method, you will end up deactivating the location services of Apple iPhone 15 completely. The steps are no rocket science and with just one toggling, you can reach to what you want. By doing this, any app in the Apple iPhone 15 that uses your location will be of no use.

Here are the steps on how to stop tracking on Apple iPhone 15 completely:

**Step 1:** Go to the “Settings” in your Apple iPhone 15 as the initial step. Now, look for “Privacy” option and tap on it.

## Method 3: Disable location tracking of specific apps

In the above section, you have stopped tracking on Apple iPhone 15 entirely which means any of the location based app or service won’t be able to locate you. Nevertheless, completely turning it off can sometimes be useless as there are some apps that need the tracking of your location so as to give you better experience. As a solution for this, you can follow the steps below and can turn off location for specific apps only. Here is how to stop tracking on Apple iPhone 15 for specific apps.

**Step 1:** Open “Settings” as usual firstly and go to “Privacy”.

**Step 2:** Go to “Location Services” and don’t toggle it off. Instead, you will find apps listed under the option.

**Step 3:** Select the apps and make adjustments according to your preferences. You can choose among “Never”, “While Using the App” and “Always”.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![make adjustments](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-specific-apps.jpg)

The first option will never send your location to the apps. Second option will use your location only when you use the particular app. And as it suggests itself, by choosing the “Always” option will always track your location.

## Method 4: Disable Significant Locations on Apple iPhone 15

Apart from the apps, Apple iPhone 15 itself keeps record of where you travel the most. These frequently visited locations are referred to as significant locations. The purpose of such tracking is to help you providing location concerned suggestions, especially when you employ Siri or other features. If you want to turn off such tracking on Apple iPhone 15, we can help you. These are the steps that you should follow in this case.

**Step 1:** From your Apple iPhone 15’s Home screen, go to the “Settings” app.

**Step 2:** Select the “Privacy” option now and head to the “Location Services” located at the top of the screen.

**Step 3:** After this, click on the “System Services” from the bottom.

![System Services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-significant-locations-1.jpg)

**Step 5:** Toggle off the green slider near “Significant Locations”. This is it!
