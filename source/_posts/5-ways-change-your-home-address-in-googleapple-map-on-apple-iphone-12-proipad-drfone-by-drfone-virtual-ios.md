## Solution 4: Fake iOS GPS by jailbreaking your systems

The next method to **fake location on Apple iPhone 12 Pro** and Android phones is by jailbreaking your device. When you jailbreak your device, you get the opportunity to make changes to most of the native settings in your device. However, this method can give a hard time as it depends on the iOS or Android version you are using. We are introducing ‘The Anywhere!’ app for this purpose and this can work on iOS 17 well. Here is the guide for this. Take the iOS system as an example:

- Download the ‘The Anywhere!’ location faking the Cydia app on your phone.
- Install and launch the app from your Home screen.
- Navigate for the location that you want to fake.
- Tap on it and a red pin will appear on the address.
- Next, tap on the blue tab on the coming screen.
- You can now select the apps on which you wish to fake GPS location on iOS.
- Open the selected app now and you could see the new location on it.
