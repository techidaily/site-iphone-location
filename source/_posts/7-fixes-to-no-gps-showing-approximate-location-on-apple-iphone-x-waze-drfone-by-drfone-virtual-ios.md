## Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone X/iPad?

Pokemon Go players always look forward to cheats and hacks that can help them catch more Pokemon in the game. While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.

One such cheat/hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.

## Part 1: What is Pokego++?

If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.

![pokego++](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg)

PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.

It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone X/iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.

## Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++

So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.

Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone X or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.

## Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++

Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks/tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon. So, if PokeGo++ doesn’t work anymore, what’s an alternative that can help you use a fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.

The answer is [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). It’s a dedicated geo-spoofing tool for iOS that comes with a built-in “Teleport Mode” feature. Thanks to this feature, you can change your smartphone’s location to anywhere in the world with a single click.

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also comes with a dedicated GPS Joystick. This means apart from changing your smartphone’s location, you can also fake your movement on the map and virtually collect different Pokemon. One of the best features of Virtual Location is that it lets you customize your movement speed. So, even if you are faking your location in the game, you can stay assured that Niantic won’t ban your account.

Here are a few key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) that makes it the best geo spoofing tool to fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.

- Use Teleport Mode to Choose Any Location Across the Globe
- Use GPS Joystick to virtually collect all your favorite Pokemon GO characters
- Customize the movement speed using a simple slider
- Automatic marching to configure your character to move in one direction automatically
- Control GPS location for up to 5 iOS devices simultaneously

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

That’s it; when you’ll launch Pokemon Go, you’ll automatically notice different streets. At this point, you can enable “GPS Joystick” and easily control your movement without walking at all.
