We’ll be making these features accessible via a new beta panel in your settings, which is rolling out to all Plus users over the course of the next week.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Are-ChatGPT-Plugins"><a href="#What-Are-ChatGPT-Plugins" class="headerlink" title="What Are ChatGPT Plugins?"></a>What Are ChatGPT Plugins?</h2><p> ChatGPT Plugins are internet-connected tools specifically designed to extend ChatGPT’s functionality.</p><p> Until now, ChatGPT’s official data cut-off point was towards the end of 2021,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/" >one of ChatGPT’s main limitations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Where other tools like Microsoft’s Bing AI Chat and the newly updated Google Bard connect to the internet to research up-to-date information, ChatGPT lagged behind.</p><p> The first set of ChatGPT Plugins was created and developed by companies such as Expedia, FiscalNote, Instacart, KAYAK, Klarna, Milo, OpenTable, Shopify, Slack, Speak, Wolfram, and Zapier, and will drastically expand ChatGPT’s understanding, integration, and usefulness.</p><p> For example, when you gain access to ChatGPT Plugins, you’ll be able to use the ChatGPT Kayak Plugin to search for and streamline holiday ideas, find the best deals, and create unique holiday ideas, all from the warm embrace of the ChatGPT interface.</p><p> Unfortunately, my ChatGPT Plus account doesn’t have access to any Plugins yet.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-Can-Browse-the-Web"><a href="#ChatGPT-Can-Browse-the-Web" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Can Browse the Web"></a>ChatGPT Can Browse the Web</h2><p>That’s not all, though.</p><p> OpenAI has also finally granted ChatGPT internet access. Again, like Google Bard and Microsoft Bing AI, ChatGPT can search the web for resources, cross-check information, reference specific data, and give you up-to-the-minute information.</p><p> When you input a web-powered ChatGPT search, it illustrates the steps it takes to search the web, the “clicks” it is making, and the process the AI follows to return information. Those who have<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-auto-gpt-how-differ-from-chatgpt/" >used Auto-GPT will find the process familiar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but it’s an enormous step forward for ChatGPT.</p><p> For example, I asked ChatGPT: “Who is the current leader of the F1 World Championship?”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-web-browsing-search-may-2023.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt web browsing search may 2023"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-web-browsing-search-may-2023-looking-for-examples.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt web browsing search may 2023 looking for examples"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873305/18544" target="_top" id="1873305"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873305"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1350"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873305/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-web-browsing-search-may-2023-results-with-source.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt web browsing search may 2023 results with source"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> As you can see from the images above, ChatGPT Plus correctly identified Max Verstappen—though I did need to prompt the tool to continue.</p><p> I then asked if ChatGPT Plus with Web Browsing could provide a list of the current F1 World Championship rankings, which it did without any extra prompting:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-web-browsing-search-may-2023-f1-world-champs.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt web browsing search may 2023 f1 world champs"                ></p><p> On both occasions, ChatGPT provided a source for its information, and on both occasions, it was accurate.</p><p> Now, these aren’t the most challenging data searches, but it shows that ChatGPT’s Web Browsing tool is up and running proper.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2095385/26400" target="_top" id="2095385"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2095385"                      border="0" alt="" width="1024" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2095385/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Enable-ChatGPT-Plugins-and-Web-Browsing"><a href="#How-to-Enable-ChatGPT-Plugins-and-Web-Browsing" class="headerlink" title="How to Enable ChatGPT Plugins and Web Browsing"></a>How to Enable ChatGPT Plugins and Web Browsing</h2><p> You can enable ChatGPT Plugins and Web Browsing using the new Beta Features Settings options.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4691139&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/SU-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Software Update Pro -

Its vibrant colors, memorable animations, and constant updates serve to keep gameplay fresh for returning players, but remain stable enough so as not to disrupt new players’ experiences.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z5kydB0kP2A67yJxqmRGCP6KuT8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_04-f788a639837845a9aead0db474cbc72d.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way"><a href="#Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way" class="headerlink" title="Plot: None, but it’s better that way"></a><strong>Plot: None, but it’s better that way</strong></h2><p> Fortnite is plot light, a battle royale designed like the Hunger Games in that it drops players onto a map with one singular goal: survive to the end of the match and be the only player, or squad, left standing. Instead of a continuous story mode, players experience dramatic shifts in the game mechanics and the map season-to-season.</p><p> These include new explorable areas, changes to existing areas, weapon buffs, and new in-game mechanics, such as fishing or the addition of boats. Past seasons have included airplanes, snowboards, mechs and more—so who knows what future seasons will hold. The Battle Royale mode can become a little repetitive over time, but that’s why new seasons are important. They change up the pace of the game and reinvigorate the interest of players. The one guarantee is that each new season brings change, and with the dawn of Chapter 2, it’s clear that Epic Games hasn’t lost their touch for re-imagining their game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u0p3ac203yN2fyC3DvKLcXMqdAY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fornite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_02-8da4487c33dc4aed81eabc862664a1f8.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play"><a href="#Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play"></a><strong>Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play</strong></h2><p> To win the Victory Royale, players compete solo, with a partner, or in squads of three to four people. Games are quick, lasting anywhere from 15-20 minutes once you get the hang of things, although it’s always possible to die earlier. The game starts by placing 100 players on Spawn Island while it queues up the teams. Once ready, everyone on the island is transported onto a Battle Bus which floats over the Fortnite map, allowing players to leap down and begin their quest to the top.</p><p> What’s better—not only is the Battle Royale mode free, but cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><p> Play is simple: loot chests, explore areas while scavenging for weapons and ammunition, chug potions to gain shields, and use your pickaxe to harvest materials by breaking down the world around you. Essentially, do whatever it takes to gear up fast and take down other players. With five item slots available, it’s important to grab at least one weapon (though we’d recommend grabbing several if you can), but the remaining slots can be used to carry healing items, potions, fishing reels, and other gear—but don’t dally too long deciding because the storm is coming.</p><p> The storm is an ever-encroaching threat that closes over set intervals and deals damage that increases over time to players trapped within its boundaries, forcing everyone closer together as the safe zone shrinks. The last team standing will claim the Victory Royale for themselves.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Good-campy-fun"><a href="#Graphics-Good-campy-fun" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Good, campy fun"></a><strong>Graphics: Good, campy fun</strong></h2><p> Fortnite’s graphics are campy, oversaturated, and brightly-colored fun making them a treat to look at. Unlike competitors such as PUBG or Apex Legends, Fortnite’s graphics trade realism for cartoonish, exaggerated features. When combined with the emotes and skins earned throughout the game, these can create some very entertaining in-game visuals.</p><p> It’s worth noting that DirectX 12 support is officially here for PC users, which means that people playing on higher quality graphics cards should see a more consistent gameplay experience thanks to an increased and more stable frame rate. If your system is older, you can play on reduced settings, but it does make the picture choppy and difficult to follow. It’ll get the job done, but we wouldn’t recommend it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Project-Manager-3D-Models-4-800x800.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1EGFvaMlK-nV8KKnng7WcI-X7iI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_03-aff88589c9a04d05a9663f5a75975706.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more"><a href="#Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more" class="headerlink" title="Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more"></a><strong>Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more</strong></h2><p> A battle royale it may be, but Fortnite’s unique building mechanics truly set the game apart and turn the heat up a notch. All that harvesting you’re doing will pay off, because for every 10 stacks of a material such as wood or stone you have, you can build a structure. Be aware that durability and build time will vary based on the selected material, so take time to experiment and find what techniques work best for you.</p><p> Building is as important as shooting, so it’s essential to learn the basics. Players can build floors, stairs, roofs, and walls, which can be used either in defense or, for the imaginative player, in offense. These structures help players gain the higher ground on the battlefield, access hard-to-reach map locations, and buy time for healing items or shielding potions. It seems counterintuitive to be building anything in a battle royale game, but within moments structures will cobble itself together before a player’s eyes.</p><p> For the more casual player, these building controls can be found on the keyboard, but binding the building keys to unused mouse buttons can quickly become an asset on the battlefield where every second counts. A seamless defense can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296985&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9cea886b9f44a3c2df1163730ab64994/products/copy_nero_burning_rom_cart.png"                      border="0"                ><br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass"><a href="#Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass" class="headerlink" title="Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass"></a><strong>Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass</strong></h2><p> The seasonal Battle Pass system offers rewards to players as they gain experience in the game, a change from the previous system Chapter 1 used which relied on leveling up through Battle Stars earned from Weekly Challenges. The shift to experience-based leveling feels much more intuitive. And honestly, it’s fun to watch the experience bar increase during the match, although it’d be better if you could toggle its presence to collapse or display in the HUD.</p><p> If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer.</p><p> Just like Chapter 1, Chapter 2’s Battle Pass offers both free and premium rewards. This is in addition to the microtransactions offered for cosmetic upgrades in the Fortnite Shop. These rewards are purely cosmetic, but offer big personalities. They vary from new skins, such as rescue workers or monsters made from Slurp Juice (the solution which shields players from damage), new gliders for launching onto the map, new pickaxes and backpacks, as well as silly dances and emotes for goofy fun.</p><p> To access the premium rewards, players need to buy into the Battle Pass by purchasing in-game currency known as V-Bucks. The Battle Pass costs 950 V-Bucks or $9.50. If you value cosmetic upgrades, it’s a fun add-on. If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer. Each Battle Pass is only valid for the season in which they are bought, so if you’re joining late in the season consider if it’s worth it to invest in a reward system you may not be able to complete.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ock_qOb167XfWuEIuPpuFC0DpUQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_Battle-Royale_Standard-Mode_05-95fe04b07a934bdbbcf8ae58496c736c.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631056&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/997e65474a248252883b485717f7d098/products/buy-windows.png"                      border="0"                >Allavsoft Batch Download Online Videos, Music Offline to MP4, MP3, MOV, etc format </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety"><a href="#Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety" class="headerlink" title="Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety"></a><strong>Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety</strong></h2><p> As if the game mechanics and the cosmetics weren’t thrilling enough, Epic Games takes the shake-ups a step further by offering alternative modes, limited-time game modes, and events with unique rewards.</p><p> These include permanent alternative modes like Team Rumble, which features teams of 50 versus 50 who compete for an elimination count to win the match, or crossover events between DC, Marvel, Stranger Things, John Wick, the NFL, and more. These crossover events aren’t just combat-based—Epic Games has gone as far as hosting a virtual concert on its servers with Marshmello, a popular DJ and Fortnite fan himself. It may seem strange, but Epic consistently seeks out ways to reinvent the game and push the boundaries of what video games are capable of handling. This ensures that Fortnite remains fresh and interesting.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4693127&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videosoftdev.com/images/video_editor/screenshots/1.jpg"                      border="0"                ><br>VSDC Pro Video Editor is a light professional non-linear video editing suite for creating a movie of any complexity.

Apex Legends is a first-person shooter meets battle royale game where 60 players are dropped onto a map competing with squads of three for domination.</p><p> Now boasting a player base of 70 million people, Apex Legends is quickly catching on Steam. All around, it feels like a more adult version of Fortnite. Instead of oversaturated, cartoonish graphics, goofy dances, and emotes, players are greeted by a more refined world that’s a glorious clash of fire and ice, and a graphics engine reminiscent of the Titanfall franchise. Running around lava fields, ziplining through ice craters, and skydiving into the skyscrapers of Capitol City is a real treat. One of the best parts of the map is the train system which spans the island, enabling quick travel between locations—and unexpected attacks of opportunity.</p><p> In addition to its fantastic graphics, Apex Legends offers a sophisticated ping system that communicates looting, enemy behavior, good-natured jibes, and movement tactics, among other call-outs. It’s a system Fortnite has even shifted into adopting, in a more limited manner. Unlike Fortnite’s weapon system, Apex Legends includes weapon attachments for additional customization options. These range from scopes, extended magazines, hop-ups to alter rate of fire, stocks, and barrel stabilizers.</p><p> Recently reaching its third season, Apex Legends offers its own Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins or $9.50, although the rewards don’t seem nearly as enticing as those offered by Fortnite. It too offers both free rewards and paid rewards for players who buy into the Battle Pass, but the free rewards are few and far between. Many of the player skins and weapon skins are fun, but their presence seems counterintuitive—particularly when you consider that you rarely see the player skins you earn in Apex Legends thanks to its first-person shooter style. The only time you can appreciate them, aside from the loading screens, are when you perform finishing moves, revive a player, or skydive, which seems strange for something you’re able to customize as well as purchase additional cosmetics for through microtransactions.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner. If you’re looking for a more advanced game, however, Apex Legends is an appealing challenger and well worth a second look—and just like Fortnite, Apex Legends is free to play. So, if you have the time, why not try both?</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A fun, fast-paced battle royale that’s rightfully taken the world by storm.</strong></p><p> Fortnite has taken the world by storm, and with over 250 million players worldwide, it’s easy to see why it’s so beloved. If you’re a fan of campy fun, vibrant graphics, third-person shooters, or battle royale games, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is well worth a look—and best of all, it is free to play. Combined with Epic Games’ continuous ability to reinvent Fortnite season after season, Fortnite Battle Royale a sure-fire winner in our books.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Fortnite Battle Royale</li><li>Product Brand  Epic Games</li><li>Price  $29.99</li><li>PC Minimum Settings  OS: Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10 64-bit, CPU: Core i3 2.4 Ghz, Memory: 4GB RAM, GPU: Intel HD 4000</li><li>PC Recommended Settings  OS: Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10 64-bit, CPU: Core Core i5 2.8 Ghz, Memory: 8GB RAM, GPU: Nvidia GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 7870 equivalent DX11 GPU</li><li>Mac Minimum Settings  OS: Mac OSX High Sierra (10.13.6+), CPU: Core i3 2.4 Ghz, Memory: 4GB RAM, GPU: Intel Iris Pro 5200</li><li>Mac Recommended Settings  OS: Mac OSX High Sierra (10.13.6+), CPU: Core i5 2.8 Ghz,Memory: 8GB RAM, GPU: Nvidia GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 7870 equivalent DX11 GPU</li><li>Platforms  PC&#x2F;Mac, Xbox One, PS4, iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch</li><li>Languages Supported  English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Latin America, Spain), Turkish</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-paving-the-way-for-smooth-video-autoplay-on-social-media-platforms/"><u>[Updated] Paving the Way for Smooth Video Autoplay on Social Media Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-frame-reconfigurator-for-videos/"><u>2024 Approved  Frame Reconfigurator for Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-premium-macpc-video-recording-software/"><u>2024 Approved  Premium Mac/PC Video Recording Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/3-facts-you-need-to-know-about-screen-mirroring-tecno-camon-20-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>3 Facts You Need to Know about Screen Mirroring Tecno Camon 20 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/5-ways-change-your-home-address-in-googleapple-map-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-maxipad-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>5 Ways Change Your Home Address in Google/Apple Map on Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max/iPad | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/6-methods-to-protect-yourself-from-location-tracking-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>6 Methods to Protect Yourself from Location Tracking on Apple iPhone 13 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/7-fixes-to-no-gps-showing-approximate-location-on-apple-iphone-se-waze-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>7 Fixes to No GPS - Showing Approximate Location on Apple iPhone SE Waze | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/7-fixes-to-no-gps-showing-approximate-location-on-apple-iphone-xs-waze-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>7 Fixes to No GPS - Showing Approximate Location on Apple iPhone XS Waze | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/a-full-review-for-itools-virtual-location-and-top-5-alternatives-for-apple-iphone-11-pro-maxipad-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>A Full Review for iTools Virtual Location and Top 5 Alternatives For Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max/iPad | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/el-boosting-mastery-unveiling-the-best-5-video-marketing-strategies/"><u>Channel Boosting Mastery  Unveiling the Best 5 Video Marketing Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/does-itools-virtual-location-not-work-on-apple-iphone-14-plusipad-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Does iTools virtual location not work On Apple iPhone 14 Plus/iPad?

The all-in-one device offers several new and improved features, explaining why this is now Fujitsu’s flagship scanner. Unlike its well-liked predecessor, the Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1500, the iX1600 includes a sizable 4.3-inch touchscreen display, faster scanning speeds, and improved software to accelerate your workflow.</p><p> It’s more than just speedy, too. The ScanSnap iX1600 offers up to 30 customizations and can connect from almost anywhere.

Thanks to so many connection options, creating individual users and separate profiles is possible depending on the scenario.</p><p> However, while the functionality is impressive, the setup could be more comfortable on mobile devices. Our reviewer says, “The mobile apps could use some polish, but the computer app works great for setting up all your profiles.” The iX1600 also scans a receipt destined for Dropbox, converts a document into an email, and transforms an array of physical documents into digital files with varying destinations.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : Yes |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner, copier</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/4MbkC2b3SzNKg75xBrsYPIC1wOw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fujitsu_ScanSnap_ix1600_03-83aeb941d40c4cd980e14cbc3cf08b9d.jpg"                      alt="Fujitsu ScanSnap ix1600"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fujitsu-scansnap-ix1600-review-5115487" >Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1600 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084399/18498" target="_top" id="2084399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084399"                      border="0" alt="" width="1125" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084399/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-for-Photos"><a href="#Best-for-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Best for Photos"></a>Best for Photos</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Perfection-V39-Document-resolution/dp/B00SSXQ7Q2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB00SSXQ7Q2" >Epson Perfection V39 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KDKAnJgG-DjrSaVRcEJTmv1ENAI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/epson-perfection-v39-46ba3e522a254eb09a078e416af72191.jpg" >Epson Perfection V39 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Perfection-V39-Document-resolution/dp/B00SSXQ7Q2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB00SSXQ7Q2" >https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Perfection-V39-Document-resolution/dp/B00SSXQ7Q2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB00SSXQ7Q2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Perfection-V39-Document-resolution/dp/B00SSXQ7Q2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB00SSXQ7Q2" >$126 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Epson-Perfection-V39-Color-Photo-and-Document-Scanner-Black/45100053?slfpid=3" >$160 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/208634/Epson-Perfection-V39-Color-Scanner/" >$120 at Office Depot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Ability to scan large documents</li><li>Easy to store</li><li>Cloud storage support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Unable to scan film</li><li>No auto document feeder</li></ul><p> If you need a scanner specifically for photos, the Epson Perfection V39 lives up to its name. The flatbed scanner is affordable and precise, producing digital documents with a 4,800<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dpi-in-graphics-1078848" >dpi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> optical resolution.</p><p> Once you’ve scanned your document or photo, you can send it directly to an email address or cloud storage like Evernote or Google Drive. If you want to scan, save, and archive aging family photos or important documents without spending a fortune, the V39 is the ideal option. The scanner also has a removable lid to conveniently scan large and bulky items such as books, making it a portable photocopier ideal for students. It’s storage-friendly, too, thanks to its well-designed build and an integrated kickstand that means you can store it vertically.</p><p> The downside? There’s no auto-document feeder, so scanning many documents can take a while. It’s also unable to scan film and is not the fastest. Still, it’s very convenient despite those flaws.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : No |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><h2 id="Best-Ease-of-Use"><a href="#Best-Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="Best Ease of Use"></a>Best Ease of Use</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-One-Touch-Document-Scanner/dp/B08PMPHKDV/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB08PMPHKDV" >Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1400 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/shwDwHz8Q0pXgE35e7eq1SIgN0M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/fujitsu-scansnap-ix1400-13556924310542afa6aaad1791081047.jpg" >Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1400 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-One-Touch-Document-Scanner/dp/B08PMPHKDV/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB08PMPHKDV" >https://www.amazon.com/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-One-Touch-Document-Scanner/dp/B08PMPHKDV/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB08PMPHKDV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-One-Touch-Document-Scanner/dp/B08PMPHKDV/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB08PMPHKDV" >$350 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-iX1400-Document-scanner-Dual-CIS-Duplex-8-5-x-118-600-dpi-40-ppm-mono-color-ADF-50-sheets-USB-3-2-Gen-1x1/145008599" >$350 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.staples.com/fujitsu-scansnap-ix1400-pa03820-b235-duplex-desktop-document-scanner-black/product%5F24478072?cid=AFF:24478072&slfpid=3" >$350 at Staples <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Individual scanning profiles</li><li>Fast scanning speed</li><li>50-sheet automatic document feeder</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>No wireless connectivity</li><li>No built-in touchscreen</li></ul><p> The Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1400 lacks the premium features of the iX1600, but it’s still handy. While there’s frustratingly no wireless connectivity or a built-in touchscreen, its scanning features are nearly indistinguishable from the pricier alternative.</p><p> Whether you’re scanning a business card, receipt, invoice, contract, or beloved photo, the iX1400 does so speedily. Our reviewer Gannon says he “didn’t come across a single time when the scanner felt as though it was trying to play catch up with my computer—even when working with large, high-DPI scans of photographic prints.”</p><p> That’s because the ScanSnap iX1400 scans at an impressive 40-page-per-minute (PPM) speed with a 50-sheet automatic document feeder, ensuring that batch scanning is effortless. The thoughtful design and excellent Fujitsu ScanSnap Home software make smooth scanning possible. The software makes it simple to create individual scanning profiles that you can toggle on as and when needed.</p><p> A single button triggers scanning with customization, meaning you can guarantee your scanned document lands in the correct location.  </p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : No |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006123/18460" target="_top" id="2006123"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006123"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006123/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0IeAW5kutDfn_eYGc0eXeSayCwo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fujitsu_ScanSnap_ix1400_02-4ca641314f2840e3888e50fb6c94b194.jpg"                      alt="Fujitsu ScanSnap ix1400"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fujitsu-scansnap-ix1400-review-5115474" >Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1400 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214"                      border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Budget"><a href="#Best-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Best Budget"></a>Best Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-CanoScan-Lide-Slim-Scanner/dp/B07G5YBS1W/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB07G5YBS1W" >Canon CanoScan LiDE400 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/J5mTovLvmWXCmF09qL52fgsreAw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/canon-canoscan-lide400-3be6a43b477343b282e4a6aea8be5718.jpg" >Canon CanoScan LiDE400 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-CanoScan-Lide-Slim-Scanner/dp/B07G5YBS1W/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB07G5YBS1W" >https://www.amazon.com/Canon-CanoScan-Lide-Slim-Scanner/dp/B07G5YBS1W/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB07G5YBS1W <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-CanoScan-Lide-Slim-Scanner/dp/B07G5YBS1W/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB07G5YBS1W" >$78 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Canon-CanoScan-LiDE-400-2996C002-4800-x-4800dpi-Color-48-bit-Internal-24-bit-External-USB-Type-C-One-Cable-For-Data-Power-Interface-Flatbed-Scanner/296175479?slpfid=3" >$99 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1428261-REG/canon%5F2996c002%5Fcanoscan%5Flide%5F400%5Fcolor.html/?BI=98&kw=CAL400&slfpid=3" >$81 at B&amp;H Photo Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Auto-scan mode</li><li>Maximum DPI for clear scans</li><li>Compact size</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Setup process for Mac users is challenging</li></ul><p> The Canon CanoScan LiDE 400 Photo and Document Scanner is a highly affordable yet effective scanner. It offers an impressive set of features for the price, including the ability to scan directly to cloud storage.</p><p> Wherever you plan to send your files, the Canon CanoScan LiDE 400’s auto-scan mode will detect the size of your documents and adjust accordingly, saving you some effort. It’ll also scan to a maximum of 4800x4800 dpi, guaranteeing precise and accurate digital scans. Buttons on the front of the scanner make scanning even more manageable, with the scanner boasting 8-second speeds.</p><p> Once scanned, it can create PDFs that can be saved directly to your computer’s hard drive. It’s all wonderfully straightforward and convenient, although there are some issues with its Mac setup process. Stick with it, though, and it pays off.</p><p> Beyond the features and price tag, there’s also the usual one-year warranty plus a year’s worth of toll-free technical phone support, which you should not need. If you’re looking for a scanner that gets the job done on a budget, the Canon CanoScan LiDE 400 Photo and Document Scanner is a great option.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : No |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><h2 id="Best-Compact"><a href="#Best-Compact" class="headerlink" title="Best Compact"></a>Best Compact</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-DS-940DW-Wireless-Compact-Document/dp/B083R46983/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB083R46983" >Brother DSmobile DS-940DW <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/r7iU27XA5p_GUkL1jUm-3QFxvnU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/brother-dsmobile-ds-940dw-ff2dd0bc3dd64c09801b7a17c2cb8080.jpg" >Brother DSmobile DS-940DW <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-DS-940DW-Wireless-Compact-Document/dp/B083R46983/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB083R46983" >https://www.amazon.com/Brother-DS-940DW-Wireless-Compact-Document/dp/B083R46983/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB083R46983 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-DS-940DW-Wireless-Compact-Document/dp/B083R46983/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB083R46983" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Brother-Portable-DS-940DW-Duplex-and-Wireless-Compact-Mobile-Document-Scanner/753713050?slfpid=3" >$200 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/brother-ds-940dw-compact-wireless-duplex-mobile-document-scanner-white/6403626.p?skuId=6403626" >$200 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Compact and portable design</li><li>Great speed for single and double-sided documents</li><li>Wi-Fi and USB connection options</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>No auto document feeder</li><li>Can’t easily process larger items</li></ul><p> Compact and ideal for any location, the Brother DSmobile DS-940DW is only about the size of a roll of plastic wrap to fit anywhere.

Wi-Fi and USB are enabled, too, so it’s easy to hook up to all your devices, whether a desktop, laptop, or mobile.</p><p> Look for aging issues with scanning multiple documents into a single PDF, which should have been resolved with the latest software update.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB, Wi-Fi |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : No |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Wireless"><a href="#Best-Wireless" class="headerlink" title="Best Wireless"></a>Best Wireless</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0757Z7NLC?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB0757Z7NLC" >Brother ADS-2700W <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dNpLawzPVownLkwtcFXMkEqgBtE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/brother-ads-2700w-922ee9ffb2874c8e82706f0bd256703f.jpg" >Brother ADS-2700W <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0757Z7NLC?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB0757Z7NLC" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0757Z7NLC?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB0757Z7NLC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0757Z7NLC?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB0757Z7NLC" >$348 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Fast scan speed and accuracy</li><li>50-page automatic feeder</li><li>Security features to protect scanned documents</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Touchscreen is only 3 inches</li><li>OCR isn’t functional when scanning to mobile devices</li></ul><p> The convenience of the Brother ADS-2700W is obvious. With extensive wireless capabilities, staying untethered with this scanner is helpful, although it also has<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ethernet-3426740" >Ethernet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> capability. Scanning is easy and efficient. Scanning to cloud storage, USB, email, a mobile device, and several other places is effortless.</p><p> The scanner’s image optimization features can automatically delete blank pages, enhance colors, and remove unnecessary backgrounds. It’ll scan with the assistance of a 50-page auto feeder. Security features include<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tls-vs-ssl-4156306" >SSL and TLS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a secure file transfer protocol, and a settings lock for those worried about scanning confidential documents.</p><p> The only real downside here is the touchscreen is pretty tiny, at just under 3 inches. That makes navigating difficult for some people, plus OCR isn’t functional when scanning to a mobile device. Despite that, the ADS-2700W is very practical and worth checking out.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB, Wi-Fi, Ethernet |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : Yes |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wifi-vs-ethernet-which-one-should-you-use-4684496" >Wi-Fi vs. Ethernet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-for-Small-Documents"><a href="#Best-for-Small-Documents" class="headerlink" title="Best for Small Documents"></a>Best for Small Documents</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ambir-Technology-DocketPort-667-Simplex-Card-Scanner-Black/10363860?slfpid=3" >Ambir DP667 Card Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wDkY6sAZgF9BT0f0IqoxojgomXQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ambir-dp667-card-scanner-b5d3428fe7f74ecca95bc960392b91b9.jpg" >Ambir DP667 Card Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ambir-Technology-DocketPort-667-Simplex-Card-Scanner-Black/10363860?slfpid=3" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ambir-Technology-DocketPort-667-Simplex-Card-Scanner-Black/10363860?slfpid=3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Staples</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ambir-Technology-DocketPort-667-Simplex-Card-Scanner-Black/10363860?slfpid=3" >$160 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.staples.com/ambir-docketport-dp667-portable-card-scanner-black/product%5F1683094" >$212 at Staples <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/689653/DocketPORT-DP667-Card-Scanner-48-bit/?slfpid=3" >$180 at Office Depot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Lightweight and portable</li><li>Designed to quickly scan cards and small documents</li><li>Can convert into PDF file</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Can only scan small items</li><li>Not the fastest at scanning</li></ul><p> If you need a scanner for small documents like business cards or pictures, the Ambir DP667 Card Scanner is perfect. It’s USB-powered and easy to use from pretty much anywhere.</p><p> It can scan business cards or documents measuring up to 4x10 inches, maintaining an impressive 600 dpi resolution. Once scanned, you can easily convert the results into<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/pdf-file-2622916" >PDF <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> documents. The downside here is the DP667 Card Scanner isn’t the fastest scanner on the market. You’ll need patience when scanning business cards, licenses, or receipts, but it’s easy to use.</p><p> Whether you’re keeping up with your networking at a conference or processing ID cards at a hotel desk, the DP667 Card Scanner has you covered. It’s as simple as it is effective.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : No |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/clOpEGj1THt62w2x85i8S4728V0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fujitsu_ScanSnap_ix1400_04-727ac7e2ff18426ba2c23a3212ff067e.jpg"                      alt="Fujitsu ScanSnap ix1400"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436"                      border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-When-Buying-Photo-and-Document-Scanners"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-When-Buying-Photo-and-Document-Scanners" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For When Buying Photo and Document Scanners"></a>What to Look For When Buying Photo and Document Scanners</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Media-Type"><a href="#Media-Type" class="headerlink" title="Media Type"></a>Media Type</h3><p> How are you planning to use it? A portable scanner might be your best option if you only scan business cards. Alternatively, if you’re looking to scan family heirlooms, you want a model that captures high-quality photos rather than focuses on OCR conversion. For an office environment, being able to scan text well is critical. Depending on your budget, higher-end units are great at everything you throw at them. They can include adjustable sliders, separate bays, and features that simplify the results.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633281&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/2_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Monthly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Scan-Speed"><a href="#Scan-Speed" class="headerlink" title="Scan Speed"></a>Scan Speed</h3><p> If you’re often short on time, impatient, or have many items to scan, you want a scanner that can keep up with you. Look at how many pages a scanner can handle per minute. Also, consider scanners with automatic document feeders if you scan many documents simultaneously. It’ll save you time and effort. However, if you only do it occasionally, you may be better off spending less or focusing on something with more features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/k1E2cV-iUFP2DRxqA5Cv59wqUW0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fujitsu_ScanSnap_ix1600_04-35e5256d360d467a9825ad999e23f8b8.jpg"                      alt="Fujitsu ScanSnap ix1600"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h3 id="Cloud-Support"><a href="#Cloud-Support" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Support"></a>Cloud Support</h3><p> Do you want to be able to access your scanned documents from anywhere? That’s an option if you pick a scanner with cloud support. Many document and photo scanners offer such functionality to scan and upload files directly to the cloud. Look for one that supports Google Drive, Dropbox, or your preferred cloud service for maximum efficiency.</p><h3 id="Portability"><a href="#Portability" class="headerlink" title="Portability"></a>Portability</h3><p> You won’t have to worry about storage if you have a large home office or small business setup. However, if you’re tight on space or want to take a document scanner with you wherever you go, look for one that’s small and lightweight. A bulky solution will only slow you down and is best suited for a permanent home in your office.  </p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What should you prioritize when buying a document scanner?<br> Every scanner is flawed, so weighing what you need most is crucial. If you need to scan documents occasionally rather than daily, the scanning speed may be less critical. In all cases, though, it’s good to look for an accurate scanner so that the results look perfect every time. An automatic document feeder is often helpful, but it’s optional if you need to scan only a few documents at a time. A better option would be to pick a scanner with suitable software to help you out.</li><li>Are different connectivity types essential?<br> Depending on how you plan to use your document scanner, having different connectivity options at your disposal can be helpful. Many scanners offer Wi-Fi support, which is useful if you plan on scanning to a mobile device or don’t want to be tied down by cables. However, Wi-Fi support is optional if you have a correctly wired home office setup.</li><li>Which is the most common type of scanner?<br> A flatbed scanner is the most common type; inserting documents is generally much more accessible. Some require you to feed the paper manually, making it tricky to do so without damaging the physical item. Look for the most convenient method for your plans. A removable lid can be helpful if you plan on scanning large documents such as books.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-leaders-in-virtual-marvel-universe-creation/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Leaders in Virtual Marvel Universe Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-bridging-images-and-words-step-by-step-text-integration-guide/"><u>[New] Bridging Images & Words  Step-by-Step Text Integration Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-explorations-reward-6-innovative-minecraft-residences-for-2024/"><u>[New] Exploration's Reward  6 Innovative Minecraft Residences for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/he-small-business-video-marketing-playbook-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Small Business Video Marketing Playbook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-resource-audio-recommendations-for-unboxing-content-creators/"><u>[New] Ultimate Resource  Audio Recommendations for Unboxing Content Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-discover-instagrams-free-filter-options-with-smart-searching-techniques-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Discover Instagram's FREE Filter Options with Smart Searching Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-from-gifs-to-stickers-comprehensive-tutorial-series-for-multiple-chat-apps/"><u>[Updated] From Gifs to Stickers  Comprehensive Tutorial Series for Multiple Chat Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-pro-rated-screen-capture-software-top-11-selections/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Pro-Rated Screen Capture Software  Top 11 Selections</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-clownfish-tones-a-straightforward-windows-method/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Clownfish Tones  A Straightforward Windows Method</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-vsco-photo-workflow-analysis/"><u>2024 Approved  The Ultimate VSCO Photo Workflow Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/4-effective-methods-fake-gps-location-on-apple-iphone-8-plusipad-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>4 Effective Methods Fake GPS Location on Apple iPhone 8 Plus/iPad | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/5-techniques-to-transfer-data-from-vivo-y78plus-to-iphone-15141312-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>5 Techniques to Transfer Data from Vivo Y78+ to iPhone 15/14/13/12 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/affordable-gopro-purchase-guide-tips-and-tricks-for-2024/"><u>Affordable GoPro Purchase Guide  Tips & Tricks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/become-a-zen-master-learn-to-quiet-down-distractions-in-gmeet-for-2024/"><u>Become a Zen Master  Learn to Quiet Down Distractions in GMeet for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/-your-views-optimal-hashtags-for-video-success-for-2024/"><u>Boost Your Views  Optimal Hashtags for Video Success for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/does-pokegoplusplus-still-work-on-apple-iphone-12-proipad-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 12 Pro/iPad? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/forgot-pattern-lock-heres-how-you-can-unlock-oneplus-pattern-lock-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>Forgot Pattern Lock?

National flags are typically rectangular or square in shape, characterized by their distinct colors, patterns, and symbols”.</p><p> Our local model came close, stating that “The Indian National Flag has five sides and was designed in 1916 to represent India’s independence movement.” While this flag did exist and did have five sides, it was the flag of the Indian Home Rule Movement—not a national flag.</p><p> None of our models could respond that the correct term for a pea-shaped object is “pisiform,” with ChatGPT going so far as to suggest that peas have a “three-dimensional geometric shape that is perfectly round and symmetrical.”</p><p> All three chatbots correctly identified Franco Malerba as an Italian astronaut and member of the European Parliament, with Bard giving an answer worded identically to a section of Malerba’s Wikipedia entry.</p><h2 id="Which-LLM-Is-Good-for-Technical-Instructions"><a href="#Which-LLM-Is-Good-for-Technical-Instructions" class="headerlink" title="Which LLM Is Good for Technical Instructions?"></a>Which LLM Is Good for Technical Instructions?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/burnt-socket-for-a-bs-1363-type-plug.jpg"                      alt="burnt socket for a  BS 1363 type plug"                ></p><p> When you have technical problems, you might be tempted to turn to a chatbot for help. While technology marches on, some things remain the same. The BS 1363 electrical plug has been in use in Britain, Ireland, and many other countries since 1947. We asked the language models how to correctly wire it up.</p><p> Cables attaching to the plug have a live wire (brown), an earth wire (yellow&#x2F;green), and a neutral wire (blue). These must be attached to the correct terminals within the plug housing.</p><p> Our Dalai implementation correctly identified the plug as “English-style,” then veered off-course and instead gave instructions for the older round-pin BS 546 plug together with older wiring colors.</p><p> ChatGPT was slightly more helpful. It correctly labeled the wiring colors and gave a materials list and a set of eight instructions. ChatGPT also suggested putting the brown wire into the terminal labeled “L,” the blue wire into the “N” terminal, and the yellow wire into “E.” This would be correct if BS1363 terminals were labeled, but they aren’t.</p><p> Bard identified the correct colors for the wires and instructed us to connect them to Live, Neutral, and Earth terminals. It gave no instructions on how to identify these.</p><p> In our opinion. none of the chatbots gave instructions sufficient to help someone correctly wire a BS 1363 electrical plug.

Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone SE device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone SE device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone SE device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone SE device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone SE device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone SE.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone SE are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone SE has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone SE device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone SE device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone SE device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone SE device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone SE device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone SE, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone SE, iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device. However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><h3 id="2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error"><a href="#2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error"></a>2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error</h3><p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone SE is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone SE, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-SE-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-SE-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone SE may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone SE’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone SE] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone SE needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone SE run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone SE device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone SE provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone SE are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone SE device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone SE device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone SE in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone SE relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone SE is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone SE. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone SE’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4691139&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/SU-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Software Update Pro - Check and update software installed on your computer. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

Here is the guide for this. Take the iOS system as an example:</p><ul><li>Download the ‘The Anywhere!’ location faking the Cydia app on your phone.</li><li>Install and launch the app from your Home screen.</li><li>Navigate for the location that you want to fake.</li><li>Tap on it and a red pin will appear on the address.</li><li>Next, tap on the blue tab on the coming screen.</li><li>You can now select the apps on which you wish to fake GPS location on iOS.</li><li>Open the selected app now and you could see the new location on it.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599951&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>Epubor Ultimate for Win：Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-ios-10.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak your device"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>We made you familiar with useful iOS location spoofers, including <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location</h2><p>One of the best indicators of an online tool’s efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics. We did not thoroughly enjoy using the iTools Virtual Location ourselves. And that is because it does not include advanced features as the iTools Virtual Location alternatives mentioned here.

The price is quite high compared to other GPS location changes in the market, but during the Trial version of the tool, iTool’s simple interface stuck with me.

I recommend the iTools Virtual Location to anyone looking to change their GPS location on their Apple iPhone SE (2020) conveniently.”</p><p><strong>Kat Napiorkowska (Self-employed)</strong></p><p><strong>Rating: 2.3&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**After reading the good description of the iTools Virtual Location from the vendor, I was really excited to try the application. But I have to say that I am quite disappointed with iTools Virtual Location. I was really excited to try iTools Virtual Location, but I have to say I am quite disappointed with the app. In my opinion, the application’s user interface is quite confusing, and I found it difficult to navigate. I also experienced some bugs and crashes while using the app, which was frustrating. The location-changing feature didn’t seem to work well for me, as the new location wasn’t accurate or consistent. I was hoping for a reliable and efficient tool, but unfortunately, iTools Virtual Location did not meet my expectations.

It allows you to move automatically, manually, and at different speeds. You can also mark the Pins in a route and make the simulation look genuine. However, the problem forces you to purchase the full Toolset to use the application. You have to pay US$ 59.95 to use one function of the tool. Aside from that, it does not use advanced algorithms, so some apps might crash or not work with iTools Virtual Location.</p><p>And that’s why we include the five best iTools Virtual Location alternatives. You can choose any of the five as they have nearly the features that iTools Virtual Location does. The first one in the alternative list, the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , is the most significant location changer in the market.

Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 8 Plus.</p><ul><li><strong>3.

In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 8 Plus’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 8 Plus] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 8 Plus needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 8 Plus run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 8 Plus provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 8 Plus are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 8 Plus in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 8 Plus relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 8 Plus is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 8 Plus. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone 8 or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.</p><p>When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 8 device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.</p><p>All we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to <strong>change location on Apple iPhone 8</strong>, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-spreadsheet-free-excel-editor-online-offline-1x.93e269d.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?"></a>Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?</h2><p>Step 1: On your Apple iPhone 8, go to the App Store app.</p><p>Step 2: Click on the “Featured” tab.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/featured-tab-app-store.jpg"                      alt="featured tab app store"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, scroll down to locate your Apple id and tap on it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1997795">                    <video width="250" height="250" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1997795">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:250px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fproteahair.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1997795%2F23621'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997795/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->![locate apple id app store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/locate-apple-id-app-store.jpg)<p>Step 4: Choose “View Apple ID”.

How do I <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-location/how-to-change-weather-location-ipad.html" >change weather location on Apple iPhone 8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</strong></p><p>If you have changed your location or the app misperceives your location, follow these steps and get accurate weather updates:</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Go to your iDevice’s weather widget and long-press to choose the “Edit Weather” option. Now, tap “My Location” to check your current location. If it’s wrong and you want to change it, type and select the exact one in the “Search” bar. This way, your weather location will be changed on the weather app on your Apple iPhone 8.</p><p><strong>2. Will changing my location affect my device’s warranty or performance?</strong></p><p>The device’s warranty generally depends on the product and has nothing to do with moving locations. Yet it’s advisable to check the terms and conditions of the warranty. You can check if those conditions cover your device regardless of location. In short, changing location will not affect your phone, but you should note its local regulations.</p><p><strong>3. Is there a risk of my account being banned in certain apps or games if I change my location?</strong></p><p>Yes, you might encounter issues in certain apps if you change location on your Apple iPhone 8. This is because some apps have terms that prohibit falsifying locations. If they observe a rapid change in location due to VPN, it could lead to a ban to maintain fair play. To avoid this issue, always use a legitimate means of updating locations and be familiar with other terms.</p><p><strong>4. How do I change my location back to my real one?</strong></p><p>If you have faked your location on your Apple iPhone 8 for certain games and applications, check the settings of your location spoofer. Within the app settings, you can revert to your actual location. Apart from that, if you are using a VPN to change location, disconnect from it. Upon turning it off, your device will return to the real location.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>In this guide, you have learned how to <strong>change location on the Apple iPhone 8</strong> in different scenarios.

Therefore, having poor signals can be the main cause of why Apple iPhone 7 Plus says “no GPS showing approximate location”.

Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone 7 Plus or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.</p><p>When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.</p><p>All we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to <strong>change location on Apple iPhone 7 Plus</strong>, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-office-pdf-editor-1x.890dbda.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?"></a>Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?</h2><p>Step 1: On your Apple iPhone 7 Plus, go to the App Store app.</p><p>Step 2: Click on the “Featured” tab.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4621764&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.x-mirage.com/x-mirage/img/page-home.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/featured-tab-app-store.jpg"                      alt="featured tab app store"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, scroll down to locate your Apple id and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/locate-apple-id-app-store.jpg"                      alt="locate apple id app store"                ></p><p>Step 4: Choose “View Apple ID”.

Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 6s Plus has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 6s Plus and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 6s Plus user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Plus Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Plus Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 6s Plus.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1412049&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-200x200.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, iPad, or other Apple devices.

In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 6s Plus’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 6s Plus] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 6s Plus needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 6s Plus run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 6s Plus provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 6s Plus are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 6s Plus in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 6s Plus relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 6s Plus. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/2044747/22993" target="_top" id="2044747"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-2044747"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2044747/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

Of course, these issues are triggered differently, but there are respective common fixes. However, some can successfully fix the problem while other solutions may hit the blank. Let’s see some of the probable solutions to the issues mentioned above.</p><ul><li><strong>Developer mode-</strong> The solution is to check for the iTools updates for your device.</li><li><strong>Not downloading-</strong> if the program fails to download, check that your device meets the system requirements. Also, make sure your payments are settled and that the internet connection is established.</li><li><strong>Map crash-</strong> If the map crashes, it might be because of a problem with the google map API or unestablished communication with iTools. If Google Maps fails, click the three horizontal lines located at the right of the menu bar and switch to Mapbox. Also, check that your internet connection is working fine. If not, try to refresh your internet connection and ensure the connection is established.</li><li><strong>Stop working-</strong> When the iTools Virtual Location stops working, it might be due to unexpected technical issues. Try restarting the program, and if it persists, restart your device.</li><li><strong>Not working on iOS 17-</strong> As aforementioned, iOS 17 has had issues with iTools. One of the best ways to ensure a smooth click with iTools is to downgrade your iOS 17 to say iOS 16. The temporary solution offered for iOS 17 seems to work on some devices only.</li><li><strong>Location won’t move-</strong> when you change your current location and fail to move on your apps say google maps or Facebook, you will find yourself in fake location. Simply restart your device, and the problem will disappear.</li><li><strong>Image load failed-</strong> This issue is often related to compatibility issues. Check if you downloaded the program after the forced PoGo updates. You can try downgrading your device if you are doing iOS 17.</li></ul><h2 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-Safer-and-Stable-Tool-To-Change-Location-iOS-17-Supported"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-Safer-and-Stable-Tool-To-Change-Location-iOS-17-Supported" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location: Safer and Stable Tool To Change Location (iOS 17 Supported)"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location: Safer and Stable Tool To Change Location (iOS 17 Supported)</h2><p>As you have seen above, iTools Virtual Location software is faced with a pile of problems that make it difficult to safely and efficiently fake GPS locations.

Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone 6s or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.</p><p>When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 6s device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.</p><p>All we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to <strong>change location on Apple iPhone 6s</strong>, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872456/14483" target="_top" id="1872456"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872456"                      border="0" alt="" width="500" height="375"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872456/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?"></a>Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?</h2><p>Step 1: On your Apple iPhone 6s, go to the App Store app.</p><p>Step 2: Click on the “Featured” tab.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653808&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/featured-tab-app-store.jpg"                      alt="featured tab app store"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, scroll down to locate your Apple id and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/locate-apple-id-app-store.jpg"                      alt="locate apple id app store"                ></p><p>Step 4: Choose “View Apple ID”.

How do I <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-location/how-to-change-weather-location-ipad.html" >change weather location on Apple iPhone 6s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</strong></p><p>If you have changed your location or the app misperceives your location, follow these steps and get accurate weather updates:</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Go to your iDevice’s weather widget and long-press to choose the “Edit Weather” option. Now, tap “My Location” to check your current location. If it’s wrong and you want to change it, type and select the exact one in the “Search” bar. This way, your weather location will be changed on the weather app on your Apple iPhone 6s.</p><p><strong>2. Will changing my location affect my device’s warranty or performance?</strong></p><p>The device’s warranty generally depends on the product and has nothing to do with moving locations. Yet it’s advisable to check the terms and conditions of the warranty. You can check if those conditions cover your device regardless of location. In short, changing location will not affect your phone, but you should note its local regulations.</p><p><strong>3. Is there a risk of my account being banned in certain apps or games if I change my location?</strong></p><p>Yes, you might encounter issues in certain apps if you change location on your Apple iPhone 6s. This is because some apps have terms that prohibit falsifying locations. If they observe a rapid change in location due to VPN, it could lead to a ban to maintain fair play. To avoid this issue, always use a legitimate means of updating locations and be familiar with other terms.</p><p><strong>4. How do I change my location back to my real one?</strong></p><p>If you have faked your location on your Apple iPhone 6s for certain games and applications, check the settings of your location spoofer. Within the app settings, you can revert to your actual location. Apart from that, if you are using a VPN to change location, disconnect from it. Upon turning it off, your device will return to the real location.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>In this guide, you have learned how to <strong>change location on the Apple iPhone 6s</strong> in different scenarios.

Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 6 device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 6 device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40203538&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/cc4b82e826b52ec41c810301548e8f48/products/audio-to-text-transcription-software.png"                      border="0"                >EaseText Audio to Text Converter for Windows (Personal Edition) - An intelligent tool to transcribe &amp; convert audio to text freely </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6 Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6 Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 6 device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 6 device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 6 device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 6 device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 6 device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 6.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 6 are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 6 has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 6 device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 6 device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 6 device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 6 device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 6 device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 6, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1725213/17190" target="_top" id="1725213"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1725213"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1725213/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 6, iPad, or other Apple devices.

In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 6’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 6] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 6 needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 6 run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 6 device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 6 provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 6 are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 6 device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 6 device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 6 in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 6 relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 6 is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 6. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 6’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=14095146&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8b6cc3ee5ec407721ce3bf5ff4c0f56b/PRO_BUY_728x90-EN.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.</p><p>From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>Coordinates</strong>: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.</li><li><strong>Routes</strong>: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).</li><li><strong>Tracks</strong>: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg"                      alt="GPX File"                ></p><p>Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?"></a>Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?</h2><p>The good thing is that there are tons of options to view GPX online on desktop, Android, or iOS platforms. Some of these freely available solutions to view GPX on Map are Google Earth, Google Maps, Bing Maps, Garmin BaseCamp, GPX Viewer, and so on.</p><p>Out of them, Google Maps is one of the most used solutions to view GPX online on smartphones and desktops alike.
