While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.</p><p>One such cheat&#x2F;hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pokego"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pokego" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Pokego++?"></a>Part 1: What is Pokego++?</h2><p>If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 15 Plus&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 15 Plus or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon. So, if PokeGo++ doesn’t work anymore, what’s an alternative that can help you use a fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.</p><p>The answer is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Ideally, a lot of people use GPX files to access a particular route offline when they are off the grid. Though, there are times when users find it hard to view GPX on a map. Don’t worry, there are plenty of ways to view GPX online or offline. In this post, I will let you know how to view GPX in Google Maps and other resourceful desktop applications in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files"><a href="#Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?"></a>Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?</h2><p>Before we discuss how to utilize a GPX view online or offline tool, let’s quickly consider how these files work. It stands for GPS Exchange format and stores map-related data in an XML format. Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.</p><p>From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>Coordinates</strong>: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.</li><li><strong>Routes</strong>: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).</li><li><strong>Tracks</strong>: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg"                      alt="GPX File"                ></p><p>Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?"></a>Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?</h2><p>The good thing is that there are tons of options to view GPX online on desktop, Android, or iOS platforms. Some of these freely available solutions to view GPX on Map are Google Earth, Google Maps, Bing Maps, Garmin BaseCamp, GPX Viewer, and so on.</p><p>Out of them, Google Maps is one of the most used solutions to view GPX online on smartphones and desktops alike.

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 14 Pro?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 14 Pro has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 14 Pro and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 14 Pro user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 14 Pro.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device. However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><h3 id="2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error"><a href="#2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error"></a>2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error</h3><p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 14 Pro, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 14 Pro may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 14 Pro’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 14 Pro] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 14 Pro needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 14 Pro run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 14 Pro provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 14 Pro are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 14 Pro in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 14 Pro. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them. While both errors involve the inaccessibility of the location services, some causes also display similarities among them.

Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 15 Plus has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 15 Plus and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 15 Plus user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Plus Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Plus Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 15 Plus.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, iPad, or other Apple devices.

However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><h3 id="2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error"><a href="#2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error"></a>2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error</h3><p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 15 Plus, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Plus Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Plus Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 15 Plus may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 15 Plus’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 15 Plus] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 15 Plus needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 15 Plus run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 15 Plus provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 15 Plus are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 15 Plus in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 15 Plus relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 15 Plus. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Does-PokeGo-still-work-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-iPad"><a href="#Does-PokeGo-still-work-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 15 Pro&#x2F;iPad?"></a>Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 15 Pro&#x2F;iPad?</h2><p>Pokemon Go players always look forward to cheats and hacks that can help them catch more Pokemon in the game. While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.</p><p>One such cheat&#x2F;hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pokego"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pokego" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Pokego++?"></a>Part 1: What is Pokego++?</h2><p>If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 15 Pro&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 15 Pro or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon. So, if PokeGo++ doesn’t work anymore, what’s an alternative that can help you use a fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.</p><p>The answer is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a dedicated geo-spoofing tool for iOS that comes with a built-in “Teleport Mode” feature.

One of the best features of Virtual Location is that it lets you customize your movement speed. So, even if you are faking your location in the game, you can stay assured that Niantic won’t ban your account.</p><p>Here are a few key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) that makes it the best geo spoofing tool to fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.</p><ul><li>Use Teleport Mode to Choose Any Location Across the Globe</li><li>Use GPS Joystick to virtually collect all your favorite Pokemon GO characters</li><li>Customize the movement speed using a simple slider</li><li>Automatic marching to configure your character to move in one direction automatically</li><li>Control GPS location for up to 5 iOS devices simultaneously</li><li>Compatible with the latest iOS version</li></ul><p>So, if you are also ready to use the best PokeGo++ alternative, here’s the detailed step-by-step process to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>That’s it; when you’ll launch Pokemon Go, you’ll automatically notice different streets. At this point, you can enable “GPS Joystick” and easily control your movement without walking at all.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Despite being a pretty useful tweaked version of Pokemon Go, PokeGO++ is not available anymore.

Mock Locations (fake GPS path)"></a>2. Mock Locations (fake GPS path)</h3><p>Mock Location (fake GPS path) works like any other tool mentioned here. It spoofs the location by providing false information via the GPS and network providers. When it comes to functioning, you can use Mock Location (fake GPS path) to spoof your location to any other location in the world.</p><p>Like Wondershare’s Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, Mock Location allows you to set two points, and it will find the route automatically.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Double-Location-Dongle-All-to-Know-About-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-iPad-GPS-Spoofing"><a href="#Double-Location-Dongle-All-to-Know-About-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-iPad-GPS-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Double Location Dongle: All to Know About Apple iPhone 14 Pro&#x2F;iPad GPS Spoofing"></a>Double Location Dongle: All to Know About Apple iPhone 14 Pro&#x2F;iPad GPS Spoofing</h2><p>If you want to prank your friends or hide your location from your apps, there are applications and GPS spoof dongles out there in the market that can help you. Double Location Dongle is one such miraculous creation that is capable of locking your location in a place you’ve never been to before. Now combined with iTeleporter, it works well for a wide range of locations, dating and gaming apps. Let’s go on and see the Double Location Dongle review.</p><h2 id="Part1-About-Double-Location-Dongle"><a href="#Part1-About-Double-Location-Dongle" class="headerlink" title="Part1. About Double Location Dongle"></a>Part1. About Double Location Dongle</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 1"                ></p><p>Not many of us are aware of Spoofing Dongles. These are very useful hardware pieces that look small but hold huge value. These are inserted into your laptop or phone’s charging port and then help you to fake your location. Double location Dongle does this job perfectly. It is conveniently compatible with the Apple devices from iOS9 to the latest iOS 13.</p><p>iTeleporter Pro 2.0 is a similar dongle that was very efficient in spoofing an individual’s location. It is now combined with Double Location and both together created three Double Location masterpieces. Apart from the obvious spoofing benefits, these have other benefits too –</p><h3 id="1-1-Double-Location-BT-2-0"><a href="#1-1-Double-Location-BT-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Double Location BT 2.0"></a>1.1 Double Location BT 2.0</h3><p>You don’t have to keep your Apple iPhone 14 Pro’s charging port occupied anymore. You can connect this Dongle to your phone by Bluetooth wirelessly. It is easy to charge this dongle too. It comes with a decent USB plug that you can insert into your Personal computer, Laptop or Desktop for easy charging.</p><h3 id="1-2-Double-Location-Mini-2-0"><a href="#1-2-Double-Location-Mini-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Double Location Mini 2.0"></a>1.2 Double Location Mini 2.0</h3><p>This dongle provides 2 in 1 benefits. On one side, it has the USB plug that will help you connect the dongle to your PC or laptop. While on the other side, you have the lightning port. If you have access to a lightning cable, it is easy to charge the iPhone and iPad with this one.</p><h3 id="1-3-Double-Location-Pro-2-0"><a href="#1-3-Double-Location-Pro-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.3 Double Location Pro 2.0"></a>1.3 Double Location Pro 2.0</h3><p>This square white beauty does a terrific job in hiding your actual location. Also, it is having 3-in-1 benefits where you can connect it to iPhone, iPad and Apple adapters as well. It has a 3.5mm headphone jack and a lightning charge port.</p><h2 id="Part2-Why-choose-Double-Location-Dongle"><a href="#Part2-Why-choose-Double-Location-Dongle" class="headerlink" title="Part2. Why choose Double Location Dongle?"></a>Part2. Why choose Double Location Dongle?</h2><p>Choosing Double Location Dongle will be a profit both because of its high functionality and long durability. Moreover, the hardware piece also provides additional benefits apart from the spoofing of location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 2"                ></p><h3 id="2-1-iOS-System-level-location-change"><a href="#2-1-iOS-System-level-location-change" class="headerlink" title="2.1 iOS System-level location change"></a>2.1 iOS System-level location change</h3><p>It provides iOS system level GPS manipulation that changes your location in all apps and even the ones with Apple protection cannot detect where you are actually seated.</p><h3 id="2-2-Safety-as-Priority"><a href="#2-2-Safety-as-Priority" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Safety as Priority"></a>2.2 Safety as Priority</h3><p>This dongle is completely safe and blocks any external interferences that try to capture your data illegally. It shields the bans from the Manufacturer’s (Apple) side. Your data and you are absolutely safe.</p><h3 id="2-3-No-Jailbreak"><a href="#2-3-No-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="2.3 No Jailbreak"></a>2.3 No Jailbreak</h3><p>Often, you might receive restrictions from the manufacturer during the GPS simulation. In that case, you have to consider jailbreak to get the job done. But Double Location doesn’t require jailbreak and smoothly gets your work done.</p><h3 id="2-4-No-need-of-PC"><a href="#2-4-No-need-of-PC" class="headerlink" title="2.4 No need of PC"></a>2.4 No need of PC</h3><p>You don’t need a computer for the Dongle to work. It is easy to attach it to your Apple iPhone 14 Pro or iPad’s charging port and then launch it into action. You can carry it wherever you go.</p><h3 id="2-5-Works-for-diverse-Apps"><a href="#2-5-Works-for-diverse-Apps" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Works for diverse Apps"></a>2.5 Works for diverse Apps</h3><p>You can spoof your location on a wide range of apps like Google Maps, Find My iPhone, Zenly, Pokémon Go, Tinder, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook among more.</p><h2 id="Part3-Why-should-you-not-choose-Double-Location-Dongle"><a href="#Part3-Why-should-you-not-choose-Double-Location-Dongle" class="headerlink" title="Part3. Why should you not choose Double Location Dongle?"></a>Part3. Why should you not choose Double Location Dongle?</h2><p>While you’ve already seen one side of the coin, it is time to see the other one. Yes, there are good benefits to Double Location but I have to mention the cons as well in this double location dongle review.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 3"                ></p><h3 id="3-1-Costly-on-Comparison"><a href="#3-1-Costly-on-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Costly on Comparison"></a>3.1 Costly on Comparison</h3><p>Double Location dongle devices are costly. Because of their high efficiency, the sellers decided to tag them with high prices that might bring a frown on your face.</p><h3 id="3-2-Slow-Delivery"><a href="#3-2-Slow-Delivery" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Slow Delivery"></a>3.2 Slow Delivery</h3><p>The delivery time is excruciatingly long. It will take a lot of time for them to deliver your piece and if you are expecting it on a particular day, you will certainly be disappointed.</p><h3 id="3-3-Website-Design"><a href="#3-3-Website-Design" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Website Design"></a>3.3 Website Design</h3><p>The website layout is a bit confusing. After iTeleporter has combined with Double Location, they made a few modifications to the site. Now it is a tiny bit confusing to navigate through the pages and get to where you want. It could be a little simpler to make life easier.</p><h3 id="3-4-Helpline-Replies"><a href="#3-4-Helpline-Replies" class="headerlink" title="3.4 Helpline Replies"></a>3.4 Helpline Replies</h3><p>The helpline center’s response is so slow that I sometimes wonder if there is a helpline team. They have their pages on Facebook and Twitter. You can chat with executives on their official websites as well. Though they promise a response within 1 hour, it is not the case most of the time.

Ideally, a lot of people use GPX files to access a particular route offline when they are off the grid. Though, there are times when users find it hard to view GPX on a map. Don’t worry, there are plenty of ways to view GPX online or offline. In this post, I will let you know how to view GPX in Google Maps and other resourceful desktop applications in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files"><a href="#Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?"></a>Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?</h2><p>Before we discuss how to utilize a GPX view online or offline tool, let’s quickly consider how these files work. It stands for GPS Exchange format and stores map-related data in an XML format. Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.</p><p>From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>Coordinates</strong>: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.</li><li><strong>Routes</strong>: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).</li><li><strong>Tracks</strong>: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg"                      alt="GPX File"                ></p><p>Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?"></a>Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?</h2><p>The good thing is that there are tons of options to view GPX online on desktop, Android, or iOS platforms. Some of these freely available solutions to view GPX on Map are Google Earth, Google Maps, Bing Maps, Garmin BaseCamp, GPX Viewer, and so on.</p><p>Out of them, Google Maps is one of the most used solutions to view GPX online on smartphones and desktops alike. As of now, you can import GPX files in the KML format or even load CSV files of exact coordinates on Google Maps. To learn how to view GPX in Google Maps, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to Your Places in Google Maps</strong></p><p>To view GPX on the map, you can first head to the official website of Google Maps on your computer.

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPad, or other Apple devices.

However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><h3 id="2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error"><a href="#2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error"></a>2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error</h3><p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

Ideally, a lot of people use GPX files to access a particular route offline when they are off the grid. Though, there are times when users find it hard to view GPX on a map. Don’t worry, there are plenty of ways to view GPX online or offline. In this post, I will let you know how to view GPX in Google Maps and other resourceful desktop applications in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files"><a href="#Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?"></a>Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?</h2><p>Before we discuss how to utilize a GPX view online or offline tool, let’s quickly consider how these files work. It stands for GPS Exchange format and stores map-related data in an XML format. Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.</p><p>From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>Coordinates</strong>: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.</li><li><strong>Routes</strong>: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).</li><li><strong>Tracks</strong>: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg"                      alt="GPX File"                ></p><p>Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?"></a>Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?</h2><p>The good thing is that there are tons of options to view GPX online on desktop, Android, or iOS platforms. Some of these freely available solutions to view GPX on Map are Google Earth, Google Maps, Bing Maps, Garmin BaseCamp, GPX Viewer, and so on.</p><p>Out of them, Google Maps is one of the most used solutions to view GPX online on smartphones and desktops alike. As of now, you can import GPX files in the KML format or even load CSV files of exact coordinates on Google Maps. To learn how to view GPX in Google Maps, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to Your Places in Google Maps</strong></p><p>To view GPX on the map, you can first head to the official website of Google Maps on your computer. Now, just click on the hamburger (three-line) icon from the top-left corner to access its options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-3.jpg"                      alt="Google Maps More Option"                ></p><p>This will display various options related to your Google Maps account. From here, you can just click on the “Your Places” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-4.jpg"                      alt="Google Maps Your Places"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose to Create a New Map</strong></p><p>As a dedicated section of “Your Places” would be launched, you can view all the saved places for your Google Maps account. Here, you can go to the “Maps” tab to view the existing saved route and spots. Since you have to view GPX in Google Maps, you can click on the “Create Map” option from the bottom to load a new map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-5.jpg"                      alt="Google Maps Create Map Option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Import and View the GPX File Online</strong></p><p>This will make Google Maps load a new page that will let you create a fresh map as per your preferences. Here, you can just click on the “Import” button to load a browser window from where you can directly load a GPX file on Google Maps and make it available offline as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-6.jpg"                      alt="Import GPX to Google Maps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-View-a-GPX-File-Offline-with-Dr-Fone-–-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-View-a-GPX-File-Offline-with-Dr-Fone-–-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to View a GPX File Offline with Dr.Fone – Virtual Location?"></a>Part 3: How to View a GPX File Offline with Dr.Fone – Virtual Location?</h2><p>Besides Google Maps, you can also take the assistance of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location to view GPX files on your computers offline. Since it is a desktop tool, it would let you load any GPX file without being connected to an active internet connection. Besides that, the application can also be used to spoof the location of your iOS device or simulate its movement in a route without jailbreaking it.</p><p>Therefore, if you want, you can first simulate the movement of your device and export the GPX file. Later, you can import the saved GPX file and simulate your Apple iPhone XS movement in the same route without any trouble.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Launch Dr.Fone – Virtual Location and connect your Apple iPhone XS</strong></p><p>At first, you can just connect your Apple iPhone XS using a working lightning cable and launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location application. Once your device is detected, just click on the “Get Started” and agree to its terms and conditions.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Simulate the Movement of your Apple iPhone XS</strong></p><p>The application would automatically detect your Apple iPhone XS on the interface with its present location. To simulate its movement, you can click on the Multi-stop or One-stop Mode icons from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="one stop mode"                ></p><p>You can now drop the pin in a route on the map and click on the “Move Here” Button to start simulating the movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="simulate movement"                ></p><p>Subsequently, you can select the number of times you want to cover the route and click on the “March” button. The application will even let you select a preferred speed for the movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png"                      alt="select the speed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Export or Import the GPX Files</strong></p><p>Once you have loaded the map on the interface, you can easily save it offline as a GPX file. To do that, just click on the Export icon from the floating menu on the side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/save-one-stop-route.png"                      alt="save one stop route"                ></p><p>Similarly, you can also import a GPX file directly to the Dr.Fone application. To do this, you just have to click on the “Import” icon from the sidebar. This will open a browser window, letting you go to a location on your computer where the GPX file is saved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/import-gpx.png"                      alt="import gpx file"                ></p><p>Once the GPX file is loaded, you can simply wait for a while and let the application process it without closing it in between.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/wait-import-gpx.png"                      alt="wait import gpx"                ></p><p>As you can see, it is pretty easy to view GPX online or offline using the right tools.

Now, look for “Privacy” option and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-completely-1.jpg"                      alt="disable location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, go for the “Location Services” and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-completely-2.jpg"                      alt="Location Services"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Slide the switch next to “Location Services” to turn the locations off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-completely-3.jpg"                      alt="use the switch"                ></p><h2 id="Method-3-Disable-location-tracking-of-specific-apps"><a href="#Method-3-Disable-location-tracking-of-specific-apps" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Disable location tracking of specific apps"></a>Method 3: Disable location tracking of specific apps</h2><p>In the above section, you have stopped tracking on Apple iPhone XS entirely which means any of the location based app or service won’t be able to locate you. Nevertheless, completely turning it off can sometimes be useless as there are some apps that need the tracking of your location so as to give you better experience. As a solution for this, you can follow the steps below and can turn off location for specific apps only. Here is how to stop tracking on Apple iPhone XS for specific apps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open “Settings” as usual firstly and go to “Privacy”.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to “Location Services” and don’t toggle it off. Instead, you will find apps listed under the option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the apps and make adjustments according to your preferences. You can choose among “Never”, “While Using the App” and “Always”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-specific-apps.jpg"                      alt="make adjustments"                ></p><p>The first option will never send your location to the apps. Second option will use your location only when you use the particular app. And as it suggests itself, by choosing the “Always” option will always track your location.</p><h2 id="Method-4-Disable-Significant-Locations-on-Apple-iPhone-XS"><a href="#Method-4-Disable-Significant-Locations-on-Apple-iPhone-XS" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Disable Significant Locations on Apple iPhone XS"></a>Method 4: Disable Significant Locations on Apple iPhone XS</h2><p>Apart from the apps, Apple iPhone XS itself keeps record of where you travel the most. These frequently visited locations are referred to as significant locations. The purpose of such tracking is to help you providing location concerned suggestions, especially when you employ Siri or other features. If you want to turn off such tracking on Apple iPhone XS, we can help you. These are the steps that you should follow in this case.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> From your Apple iPhone XS’s Home screen, go to the “Settings” app.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the “Privacy” option now and head to the “Location Services” located at the top of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After this, click on the “System Services” from the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-significant-locations-1.jpg"                      alt="System Services"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Look for “Significant Locations”. You will be prompted to use your password or touch ID to access the feature. Do it right away.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Toggle off the green slider near “Significant Locations”. This is it!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-significant-locations-2.jpg"                      alt="Significant Locations"                ></p><h2 id="Method-5-Disable-Share-My-Location-service"><a href="#Method-5-Disable-Share-My-Location-service" class="headerlink" title="Method 5: Disable Share My Location service"></a>Method 5: Disable Share My Location service</h2><p>The feature “Share My Locations” enables you to share your locations with your family and friends.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Double-Location-Dongle-All-to-Know-About-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-iPad-GPS-Spoofing"><a href="#Double-Location-Dongle-All-to-Know-About-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-iPad-GPS-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Double Location Dongle: All to Know About Apple iPhone 14 Pro&#x2F;iPad GPS Spoofing"></a>Double Location Dongle: All to Know About Apple iPhone 14 Pro&#x2F;iPad GPS Spoofing</h2><p>If you want to prank your friends or hide your location from your apps, there are applications and GPS spoof dongles out there in the market that can help you. Double Location Dongle is one such miraculous creation that is capable of locking your location in a place you’ve never been to before. Now combined with iTeleporter, it works well for a wide range of locations, dating and gaming apps. Let’s go on and see the Double Location Dongle review.</p><h2 id="Part1-About-Double-Location-Dongle"><a href="#Part1-About-Double-Location-Dongle" class="headerlink" title="Part1. About Double Location Dongle"></a>Part1. About Double Location Dongle</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 1"                ></p><p>Not many of us are aware of Spoofing Dongles. These are very useful hardware pieces that look small but hold huge value. These are inserted into your laptop or phone’s charging port and then help you to fake your location. Double location Dongle does this job perfectly. It is conveniently compatible with the Apple devices from iOS9 to the latest iOS 13.</p><p>iTeleporter Pro 2.0 is a similar dongle that was very efficient in spoofing an individual’s location. It is now combined with Double Location and both together created three Double Location masterpieces. Apart from the obvious spoofing benefits, these have other benefits too –</p><h3 id="1-1-Double-Location-BT-2-0"><a href="#1-1-Double-Location-BT-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Double Location BT 2.0"></a>1.1 Double Location BT 2.0</h3><p>You don’t have to keep your Apple iPhone 14 Pro’s charging port occupied anymore. You can connect this Dongle to your phone by Bluetooth wirelessly. It is easy to charge this dongle too. It comes with a decent USB plug that you can insert into your Personal computer, Laptop or Desktop for easy charging.</p><h3 id="1-2-Double-Location-Mini-2-0"><a href="#1-2-Double-Location-Mini-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Double Location Mini 2.0"></a>1.2 Double Location Mini 2.0</h3><p>This dongle provides 2 in 1 benefits. On one side, it has the USB plug that will help you connect the dongle to your PC or laptop. While on the other side, you have the lightning port. If you have access to a lightning cable, it is easy to charge the iPhone and iPad with this one.</p><h3 id="1-3-Double-Location-Pro-2-0"><a href="#1-3-Double-Location-Pro-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.3 Double Location Pro 2.0"></a>1.3 Double Location Pro 2.0</h3><p>This square white beauty does a terrific job in hiding your actual location. Also, it is having 3-in-1 benefits where you can connect it to iPhone, iPad and Apple adapters as well. It has a 3.5mm headphone jack and a lightning charge port.</p><h2 id="Part2-Why-choose-Double-Location-Dongle"><a href="#Part2-Why-choose-Double-Location-Dongle" class="headerlink" title="Part2. Why choose Double Location Dongle?"></a>Part2. Why choose Double Location Dongle?</h2><p>Choosing Double Location Dongle will be a profit both because of its high functionality and long durability. Moreover, the hardware piece also provides additional benefits apart from the spoofing of location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 2"                ></p><h3 id="2-1-iOS-System-level-location-change"><a href="#2-1-iOS-System-level-location-change" class="headerlink" title="2.1 iOS System-level location change"></a>2.1 iOS System-level location change</h3><p>It provides iOS system level GPS manipulation that changes your location in all apps and even the ones with Apple protection cannot detect where you are actually seated.</p><h3 id="2-2-Safety-as-Priority"><a href="#2-2-Safety-as-Priority" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Safety as Priority"></a>2.2 Safety as Priority</h3><p>This dongle is completely safe and blocks any external interferences that try to capture your data illegally. It shields the bans from the Manufacturer’s (Apple) side. Your data and you are absolutely safe.</p><h3 id="2-3-No-Jailbreak"><a href="#2-3-No-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="2.3 No Jailbreak"></a>2.3 No Jailbreak</h3><p>Often, you might receive restrictions from the manufacturer during the GPS simulation. In that case, you have to consider jailbreak to get the job done. But Double Location doesn’t require jailbreak and smoothly gets your work done.</p><h3 id="2-4-No-need-of-PC"><a href="#2-4-No-need-of-PC" class="headerlink" title="2.4 No need of PC"></a>2.4 No need of PC</h3><p>You don’t need a computer for the Dongle to work. It is easy to attach it to your Apple iPhone 14 Pro or iPad’s charging port and then launch it into action. You can carry it wherever you go.</p><h3 id="2-5-Works-for-diverse-Apps"><a href="#2-5-Works-for-diverse-Apps" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Works for diverse Apps"></a>2.5 Works for diverse Apps</h3><p>You can spoof your location on a wide range of apps like Google Maps, Find My iPhone, Zenly, Pokémon Go, Tinder, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook among more.</p><h2 id="Part3-Why-should-you-not-choose-Double-Location-Dongle"><a href="#Part3-Why-should-you-not-choose-Double-Location-Dongle" class="headerlink" title="Part3. Why should you not choose Double Location Dongle?"></a>Part3. Why should you not choose Double Location Dongle?</h2><p>While you’ve already seen one side of the coin, it is time to see the other one. Yes, there are good benefits to Double Location but I have to mention the cons as well in this double location dongle review.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 3"                ></p><h3 id="3-1-Costly-on-Comparison"><a href="#3-1-Costly-on-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Costly on Comparison"></a>3.1 Costly on Comparison</h3><p>Double Location dongle devices are costly. Because of their high efficiency, the sellers decided to tag them with high prices that might bring a frown on your face.</p><h3 id="3-2-Slow-Delivery"><a href="#3-2-Slow-Delivery" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Slow Delivery"></a>3.2 Slow Delivery</h3><p>The delivery time is excruciatingly long. It will take a lot of time for them to deliver your piece and if you are expecting it on a particular day, you will certainly be disappointed.</p><h3 id="3-3-Website-Design"><a href="#3-3-Website-Design" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Website Design"></a>3.3 Website Design</h3><p>The website layout is a bit confusing. After iTeleporter has combined with Double Location, they made a few modifications to the site. Now it is a tiny bit confusing to navigate through the pages and get to where you want. It could be a little simpler to make life easier.</p><h3 id="3-4-Helpline-Replies"><a href="#3-4-Helpline-Replies" class="headerlink" title="3.4 Helpline Replies"></a>3.4 Helpline Replies</h3><p>The helpline center’s response is so slow that I sometimes wonder if there is a helpline team. They have their pages on Facebook and Twitter. You can chat with executives on their official websites as well. Though they promise a response within 1 hour, it is not the case most of the time. They do reply but not when you most need it.</p><h2 id="Part4-How-to-use-Double-Location-Dongle-for-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-iPad-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part4-How-to-use-Double-Location-Dongle-for-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-iPad-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part4.

How to use Double Location Dongle for Apple iPhone 14 Pro&#x2F;iPad GPS spoofing</h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Connect the Dongle to your desired device</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Enter the iOS Companion app to activate the benefits. When you purchase your dongle, the sellers will give you access to this link too. This one is required for availing of all benefits.</p><p><strong>Benefit 1:</strong> Using coordinates or specific location, lock your spoof location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 5"                ></p><p><strong>Benefit 2:</strong> Create a virtual illusion like you are riding a bike or driving a car in your new location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 6"                ></p><p><strong>Benefit 3:</strong> Gives access to in-game controls where you can tilt your phone and move your game character.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-7.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 7"                ></p><p><strong>Benefit 4:</strong> Use another android or iPhone device as a joystick to control your character in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-8.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 8"                ></p><p>You need to select your location before you enter the game and not after it.</p><h2 id="Part5-Any-PC-program-if-Double-Location-Dongle-fails-to-work"><a href="#Part5-Any-PC-program-if-Double-Location-Dongle-fails-to-work" class="headerlink" title="Part5. Any PC program if Double Location Dongle fails to work?"></a>Part5. Any PC program if Double Location Dongle fails to work?</h2><p>In case you have no access to Double Location Dongle or it is not working, you can go for other computer spoofing experts like dr. fone and iSpoofer.</p><p>iSpoofer is system software that helps in hiding your locations in the games or office devices. You can purchase it as a quarterly plan for household use or as a Monthly plan for an organization with many computer devices.

While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.</p><p>One such cheat&#x2F;hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pokego"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pokego" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Pokego++?"></a>Part 1: What is Pokego++?</h2><p>If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 14 Pro&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 14 Pro or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon.

While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 14 Pro and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 14 Pro user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 14 Pro.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, iPad, or other Apple devices.

Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 14 Pro, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 14 Pro may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 14 Pro’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 14 Pro] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 14 Pro needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 14 Pro run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 14 Pro provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 14 Pro are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 14 Pro in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 14 Pro. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location"></a>Part 3. User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location</h2><p>One of the best indicators of an online tool’s efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics. We did not thoroughly enjoy using the iTools Virtual Location ourselves. And that is because it does not include advanced features as the iTools Virtual Location alternatives mentioned here. Nevertheless, it is also good to look at other users’ feedback, so here are a few reviews from iTools users:</p><p><strong>Sri Viswakarma (Content Manager, Greenland LLC.)</strong></p><p><strong>Ratings: 4.8&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**I recently started using the iTools Virtual Location application, and I am impressed that it delivers on its promise. The price is quite high compared to other GPS location changes in the market, but during the Trial version of the tool, iTool’s simple interface stuck with me.

I recommend the iTools Virtual Location to anyone looking to change their GPS location on their Apple iPhone XS conveniently.”</p><p><strong>Kat Napiorkowska (Self-employed)</strong></p><p><strong>Rating: 2.3&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**After reading the good description of the iTools Virtual Location from the vendor, I was really excited to try the application. But I have to say that I am quite disappointed with iTools Virtual Location. I was really excited to try iTools Virtual Location, but I have to say I am quite disappointed with the app. In my opinion, the application’s user interface is quite confusing, and I found it difficult to navigate.

I was hoping for a reliable and efficient tool, but unfortunately, iTools Virtual Location did not meet my expectations. I would not recommend this app to others.”</p><h2 id="Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-iTools-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-iTools-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Double-Location-Dongle-All-to-Know-About-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-iPad-GPS-Spoofing"><a href="#Double-Location-Dongle-All-to-Know-About-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-iPad-GPS-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Double Location Dongle: All to Know About Apple iPhone 15 Pro&#x2F;iPad GPS Spoofing"></a>Double Location Dongle: All to Know About Apple iPhone 15 Pro&#x2F;iPad GPS Spoofing</h2><p>If you want to prank your friends or hide your location from your apps, there are applications and GPS spoof dongles out there in the market that can help you. Double Location Dongle is one such miraculous creation that is capable of locking your location in a place you’ve never been to before. Now combined with iTeleporter, it works well for a wide range of locations, dating and gaming apps. Let’s go on and see the Double Location Dongle review.</p><h2 id="Part1-About-Double-Location-Dongle"><a href="#Part1-About-Double-Location-Dongle" class="headerlink" title="Part1. About Double Location Dongle"></a>Part1. About Double Location Dongle</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 1"                ></p><p>Not many of us are aware of Spoofing Dongles. These are very useful hardware pieces that look small but hold huge value. These are inserted into your laptop or phone’s charging port and then help you to fake your location. Double location Dongle does this job perfectly. It is conveniently compatible with the Apple devices from iOS9 to the latest iOS 13.</p><p>iTeleporter Pro 2.0 is a similar dongle that was very efficient in spoofing an individual’s location. It is now combined with Double Location and both together created three Double Location masterpieces. Apart from the obvious spoofing benefits, these have other benefits too –</p><h3 id="1-1-Double-Location-BT-2-0"><a href="#1-1-Double-Location-BT-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Double Location BT 2.0"></a>1.1 Double Location BT 2.0</h3><p>You don’t have to keep your Apple iPhone 15 Pro’s charging port occupied anymore. You can connect this Dongle to your phone by Bluetooth wirelessly. It is easy to charge this dongle too. It comes with a decent USB plug that you can insert into your Personal computer, Laptop or Desktop for easy charging.</p><h3 id="1-2-Double-Location-Mini-2-0"><a href="#1-2-Double-Location-Mini-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Double Location Mini 2.0"></a>1.2 Double Location Mini 2.0</h3><p>This dongle provides 2 in 1 benefits. On one side, it has the USB plug that will help you connect the dongle to your PC or laptop. While on the other side, you have the lightning port. If you have access to a lightning cable, it is easy to charge the iPhone and iPad with this one.</p><h3 id="1-3-Double-Location-Pro-2-0"><a href="#1-3-Double-Location-Pro-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.3 Double Location Pro 2.0"></a>1.3 Double Location Pro 2.0</h3><p>This square white beauty does a terrific job in hiding your actual location. Also, it is having 3-in-1 benefits where you can connect it to iPhone, iPad and Apple adapters as well. It has a 3.5mm headphone jack and a lightning charge port.</p><h2 id="Part2-Why-choose-Double-Location-Dongle"><a href="#Part2-Why-choose-Double-Location-Dongle" class="headerlink" title="Part2. Why choose Double Location Dongle?"></a>Part2. Why choose Double Location Dongle?</h2><p>Choosing Double Location Dongle will be a profit both because of its high functionality and long durability. Moreover, the hardware piece also provides additional benefits apart from the spoofing of location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 2"                ></p><h3 id="2-1-iOS-System-level-location-change"><a href="#2-1-iOS-System-level-location-change" class="headerlink" title="2.1 iOS System-level location change"></a>2.1 iOS System-level location change</h3><p>It provides iOS system level GPS manipulation that changes your location in all apps and even the ones with Apple protection cannot detect where you are actually seated.</p><h3 id="2-2-Safety-as-Priority"><a href="#2-2-Safety-as-Priority" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Safety as Priority"></a>2.2 Safety as Priority</h3><p>This dongle is completely safe and blocks any external interferences that try to capture your data illegally. It shields the bans from the Manufacturer’s (Apple) side. Your data and you are absolutely safe.</p><h3 id="2-3-No-Jailbreak"><a href="#2-3-No-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="2.3 No Jailbreak"></a>2.3 No Jailbreak</h3><p>Often, you might receive restrictions from the manufacturer during the GPS simulation. In that case, you have to consider jailbreak to get the job done. But Double Location doesn’t require jailbreak and smoothly gets your work done.</p><h3 id="2-4-No-need-of-PC"><a href="#2-4-No-need-of-PC" class="headerlink" title="2.4 No need of PC"></a>2.4 No need of PC</h3><p>You don’t need a computer for the Dongle to work. It is easy to attach it to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad’s charging port and then launch it into action. You can carry it wherever you go.</p><h3 id="2-5-Works-for-diverse-Apps"><a href="#2-5-Works-for-diverse-Apps" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Works for diverse Apps"></a>2.5 Works for diverse Apps</h3><p>You can spoof your location on a wide range of apps like Google Maps, Find My iPhone, Zenly, Pokémon Go, Tinder, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook among more.</p><h2 id="Part3-Why-should-you-not-choose-Double-Location-Dongle"><a href="#Part3-Why-should-you-not-choose-Double-Location-Dongle" class="headerlink" title="Part3. Why should you not choose Double Location Dongle?"></a>Part3. Why should you not choose Double Location Dongle?</h2><p>While you’ve already seen one side of the coin, it is time to see the other one. Yes, there are good benefits to Double Location but I have to mention the cons as well in this double location dongle review.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 3"                ></p><h3 id="3-1-Costly-on-Comparison"><a href="#3-1-Costly-on-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Costly on Comparison"></a>3.1 Costly on Comparison</h3><p>Double Location dongle devices are costly. Because of their high efficiency, the sellers decided to tag them with high prices that might bring a frown on your face.</p><h3 id="3-2-Slow-Delivery"><a href="#3-2-Slow-Delivery" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Slow Delivery"></a>3.2 Slow Delivery</h3><p>The delivery time is excruciatingly long. It will take a lot of time for them to deliver your piece and if you are expecting it on a particular day, you will certainly be disappointed.</p><h3 id="3-3-Website-Design"><a href="#3-3-Website-Design" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Website Design"></a>3.3 Website Design</h3><p>The website layout is a bit confusing. After iTeleporter has combined with Double Location, they made a few modifications to the site. Now it is a tiny bit confusing to navigate through the pages and get to where you want. It could be a little simpler to make life easier.</p><h3 id="3-4-Helpline-Replies"><a href="#3-4-Helpline-Replies" class="headerlink" title="3.4 Helpline Replies"></a>3.4 Helpline Replies</h3><p>The helpline center’s response is so slow that I sometimes wonder if there is a helpline team. They have their pages on Facebook and Twitter. You can chat with executives on their official websites as well. Though they promise a response within 1 hour, it is not the case most of the time. They do reply but not when you most need it.</p><h2 id="Part4-How-to-use-Double-Location-Dongle-for-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-iPad-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part4-How-to-use-Double-Location-Dongle-for-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-iPad-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part4.

Perhaps you are moving to another region, so you have to make changes with your Apple ID to get App Store access. Or it could be the case that you want to change your region to access a certain application. Whatever your reason is to change your location on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro, you have come to the right place. In this post, we have discussed everything you should know about to <strong>spoof location on Apple iPhone 15 Pro</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Experience the freedom to teleport anywhere with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location!

Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone 15 Pro or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.</p><p>When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device.

They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well.

Remember that the “Find My Friends” app is only available on iOS 12 or below. IOS 13 users need to install the “Find My” app to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/see-someones-location-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="open find friends app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After installing the app on the target’s phone, open it and tap on the contact picture to activate the toggle called “Share My Location.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/see-someones-location-iphone-8.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To begin sharing the location of the target’s phone to your device, swipe up on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to use AirDrop and make your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max discoverable by clicking on “Everyone.” Tap “Add” on the target device and then choose the option of “Share Indefinitely.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/see-someones-location-iphone-9.jpg"                      alt="select the location sharing time"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You would receive a notification message asking for permission to accept the target’s location and share your location on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max.

Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone SE (2020) and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone SE (2020) user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE (2020) Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE (2020) Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone SE (2020).</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone SE (2020) are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone SE (2020) has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone SE (2020), which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone SE (2020), iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device. However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><h3 id="2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error"><a href="#2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error"></a>2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error</h3><p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone SE (2020) is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone SE (2020), which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE (2020) Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE (2020) Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone SE (2020) may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone SE (2020)’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone SE (2020)] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone SE (2020) needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone SE (2020) run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone SE (2020) provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone SE (2020) are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone SE (2020) in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone SE (2020) relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone SE (2020) is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone SE (2020). You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone SE (2020)’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them. While both errors involve the inaccessibility of the location services, some causes also display similarities among them. However, there still is a difference in the errors, which is marked by the following table.
