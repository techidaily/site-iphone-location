While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.</p><p>One such cheat&#x2F;hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pokego"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pokego" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Pokego++?"></a>Part 1: What is Pokego++?</h2><p>If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 7&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 7 or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977032">                    <video width="80" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977032">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977032%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977032/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++<p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon.

For instance, if you use Safari, then you might be familiar with the autofill feature. While filling a form in Safari, it would automatically detect the fields and will enter the relevant information on its own. Therefore, if you have changed your home address on Maps, then it is recommended to reflect that on Safari as well. In this way, the application can enter your changed address while autofilling a form. Here’s a simple tweak that you can do to change home address in Apple iPhone 7 autofill.</p><p>Step 1. Firstly, you need to follow the above-mentioned drill and go to your own contact card to change your home address.</p><p>Step 2. Once you have changed your home address in contacts, just go to your Apple iPhone 7’s Settings &gt; Safari and tap on the “Autofill” option under the General section.</p><p>Step 3. Here, you can view details related to the automatic filling of contacts, names, passwords, credit cards, etc. Firstly, make sure that the option to autofill contacts info is enabled.</p><p>Step 4. Now, tap on the “My Info” option to view your details like name, email, address, and so on. Just go to the “Address” field and manually enter your new address to change it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/change-home-address-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="change home address Apple iPhone 7 7"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2024347/7443" target="_top" id="2024347">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2024347" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2024347/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: How to Change Home Address in Google Maps on Apple iPhone 7?<p>While Apple Maps is the native navigation application in Apple iPhone 7, a lot of people also prefer using Google Maps. Already used by over a billion people worldwide, Google Maps is the most popular and reliable navigation app in the world that runs on Android and Apple iPhone 7 alike. Though, unlike Apple Maps, Google Maps lets us save our home, work, or any other addresses in the app itself. In this way, you can easily share your address with others and select your home address for commuting. To learn how to change home address on Apple iPhone 7’s Google Maps app, just follow these steps:</p><p>Step 1. To start with, just unlock your Apple iPhone 7 and launch the Google Maps application on it. Beforehand, make sure that you are connected to a stable internet connection.</p><p>Step 2. Once Google Maps is launched, tap on the hamburger icon at the top-left corner to get more options (like your places, timeline, and more). From here, just tap on the “Your Places” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/change-home-address-iphone-8.jpg"                      alt="change home address Apple iPhone 7 8"                ></p><p>Step 3. This will list out all the saved addresses on the screen like your home, work, etc. To add or change your home address, you can just tap on the “Home” field here.</p><p>Step 4. Now, all you got to do is tap on the search bar and enter your home address so that Google Maps would automatically load it. You can also tap on the “Choose on Map” field to find the home address easily on Google Maps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/change-home-address-iphone-9.jpg"                      alt="change home address Apple iPhone 7 9"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938750/19272" target="_top" id="1938750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938750/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->Step 5. That’s it! You can now save the changes you have made and review them whenever you want. To make any changes to it, you can just tap on the three-dot icon adjacent to the Home button. This will let you edit your home address, remove it, and add directions.<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/change-home-address-iphone-10.jpg"                      alt="change home address Apple iPhone 7 10"                ></p><p>That’s a wrap, everyone! I’m sure that after reading this guide you would be able to change home address on Apple iPhone 7 like a pro. To make things easier for you, I have come up with a step-by-step tutorial on how to change home address on Apple iPhone 7 via Apple Maps as well as Google Maps. Furthermore, I have also listed a smart solution to change your address in Safari’s autofill to save your time. Well, this is what I did when I wanted to know how do I change my home address on Apple iPhone 7 a while back. You can follow this drill and share this guide with others to teach them the same.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual

Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone SE and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone SE user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone SE device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone SE device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone SE device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone SE device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone SE device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006960/19272" target="_top" id="2006960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006960/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE Say, "Location Not Available"?<p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone SE device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone SE device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone SE device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone SE device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone SE device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone SE.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone SE are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone SE has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone SE device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone SE device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone SE device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone SE device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone SE device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone SE, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone SE, iPad, or other Apple devices.

Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone SE, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-SE-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-SE-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone SE may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone SE’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone SE] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone SE needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone SE run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone SE device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone SE provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone SE are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone SE device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone SE device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone SE in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone SE relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone SE is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone SE. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone SE’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049383/7443" target="_top" id="2049383">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049383" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049383/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: "No Location Found" vs. "Location Not Available" in Find My App<p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

Let’s look into the instructions to understand the prevailing differences:</p><p><strong>For Apple iPhone SE with Home Button</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To turn off an Apple iPhone SE with the Home button, you have to hold the “Power” button on the side.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> This opens a new screen where you have to turn off the Apple iPhone SE with the slider.

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone SE (2022)?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone SE (2022) has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone SE (2022) and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone SE (2022) user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484944/16446" target="_top" id="1484944">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484944" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484944/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE (2022) Say, "Location Not Available"?<p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone SE (2022).</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone SE (2022) are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone SE (2022) has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone SE (2022), which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone SE (2022), iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device. However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657386/16446" target="_top" id="1657386">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657386" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657386/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.1 Understanding the "No Location Found" Error<p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone SE (2022), which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087239/19272" target="_top" id="2087239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087239/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE (2022) Say, "No Location Found"?<p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone SE (2022) may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone SE (2022)’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone SE (2022)] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone SE (2022) needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone SE (2022) run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone SE (2022) provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone SE (2022) are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone SE (2022) in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone SE (2022) relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7.

These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.<p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone SE (2022)&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983545">                    <video width="360" height="150" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983545">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983545%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983545/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++<p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone SE (2022) or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon. So, if PokeGo++ doesn’t work anymore, what’s an alternative that can help you use a fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.</p><p>The answer is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Similarly, if the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977028">                    <video width="80" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977028.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977028">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977028.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977028%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977028/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE (2022) Say, "Location Not Available"?<p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone SE (2022).</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone SE (2022) are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone SE (2022) has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone SE (2022), which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135361/19272" target="_top" id="2135361">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135361" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135361/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: What Does "No Location Found" Mean in Find My App?<p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone SE (2022), iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device. However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><h3 id="2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error"><a href="#2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error"></a>2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error</h3><p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone SE (2022), which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE (2022) Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE (2022) Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone SE (2022) may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone SE (2022)’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone SE (2022)] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone SE (2022) needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone SE (2022) run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone SE (2022) provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone SE (2022) are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone SE (2022) in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone SE (2022) relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone SE (2022). You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone SE (2022)’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them. While both errors involve the inaccessibility of the location services, some causes also display similarities among them. However, there still is a difference in the errors, which is marked by the following table.

Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone SE (2020) and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone SE (2020) user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528703/16446" target="_top" id="1528703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528703/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE (2020) Say, "Location Not Available"?<p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone SE (2020).</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone SE (2020) are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone SE (2020) has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone SE (2020), which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone SE (2020), iPad, or other Apple devices.

Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone SE (2020), which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111982/7443" target="_top" id="2111982">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111982" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111982/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone SE (2020) Say, "No Location Found"?<p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone SE (2020) may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone SE (2020)’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone SE (2020)] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone SE (2020) needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone SE (2020) run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone SE (2020) provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone SE (2020) are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone SE (2020) in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone SE (2020) relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone SE (2020) is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone SE (2020). You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone SE (2020)’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them. While both errors involve the inaccessibility of the location services, some causes also display similarities among them. However, there still is a difference in the errors, which is marked by the following table.

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 8 Plus?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 8 Plus has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 8 Plus and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 8 Plus user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012434/19272" target="_top" id="2012434">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012434" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012434/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 8 Plus Say, "Location Not Available"?<p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 8 Plus.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 8 Plus are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 8 Plus has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 8 Plus, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 8 Plus, iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device. However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1516072">                    <video width="540" height="960" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1516072.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1516072">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1516072.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1516072%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1516072/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.1 Understanding the "No Location Found" Error<p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone 8 Plus is unable to determine its current location.

In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 8 Plus’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 8 Plus] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 8 Plus needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 8 Plus run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 8 Plus provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 8 Plus are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 8 Plus in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 8 Plus relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 8 Plus is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 8 Plus. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them. While both errors involve the inaccessibility of the location services, some causes also display similarities among them. However, there still is a difference in the errors, which is marked by the following table.

Whichever mode you are in as either one-stop, multi-stop, or teleport mode.</li><li><strong>Automatic marching-</strong> with one click, you can make GPS spot the move automatically. You can change the directions in real time.</li><li><strong>Change directions up to 360 degrees-</strong> use the direction arrows to set the desired movement direction.</li><li><strong>Works with all GPS-</strong> based AR games or apps.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082527/7443" target="_top" id="2082527">  <img

Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 8 and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 8 user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 8 device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 8 device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 8 device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 8 device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 8 device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2002019/7443" target="_top" id="2002019">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2002019" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2002019/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 8 Say, "Location Not Available"?<p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 8 device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 8 device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 8 device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 8 device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 8 device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 8.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 8 are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 8 has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 8 device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 8 device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 8 device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 8 device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 8 device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 8, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049388/7443" target="_top" id="2049388">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049388" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049388/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: What Does "No Location Found" Mean in Find My App?<p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 8, iPad, or other Apple devices.

Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 8, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896546/19272" target="_top" id="1896546">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896546" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896546/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 8 Say, "No Location Found"?<p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 8 may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 8’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 8] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 8 needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 8 run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 8 device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 8 provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 8 are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 8 device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 8 device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 8 in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 8 relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 8 is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 8. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 8’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.<p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 8&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 8 or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon.

Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone 8 or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.</p><p>When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 8 device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.</p><p>All we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to <strong>change location on Apple iPhone 8</strong>, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1912746">                    <video width="150" height="125" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1912746">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fmindmanager.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1912746%2F20231'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1912746/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?<p>Step 1: On your Apple iPhone 8, go to the App Store app.</p><p>Step 2: Click on the “Featured” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/featured-tab-app-store.jpg"                      alt="featured tab app store"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, scroll down to locate your Apple id and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/locate-apple-id-app-store.jpg"                      alt="locate apple id app store"                ></p><p>Step 4: Choose “View Apple ID”.

How do I <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-location/how-to-change-weather-location-ipad.html" >change weather location on Apple iPhone 8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</strong></p><p>If you have changed your location or the app misperceives your location, follow these steps and get accurate weather updates:</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Go to your iDevice’s weather widget and long-press to choose the “Edit Weather” option. Now, tap “My Location” to check your current location. If it’s wrong and you want to change it, type and select the exact one in the “Search” bar. This way, your weather location will be changed on the weather app on your Apple iPhone 8.</p><p><strong>2. Will changing my location affect my device’s warranty or performance?</strong></p><p>The device’s warranty generally depends on the product and has nothing to do with moving locations. Yet it’s advisable to check the terms and conditions of the warranty. You can check if those conditions cover your device regardless of location. In short, changing location will not affect your phone, but you should note its local regulations.</p><p><strong>3. Is there a risk of my account being banned in certain apps or games if I change my location?</strong></p><p>Yes, you might encounter issues in certain apps if you change location on your Apple iPhone 8. This is because some apps have terms that prohibit falsifying locations. If they observe a rapid change in location due to VPN, it could lead to a ban to maintain fair play. To avoid this issue, always use a legitimate means of updating locations and be familiar with other terms.</p><p><strong>4. How do I change my location back to my real one?</strong></p><p>If you have faked your location on your Apple iPhone 8 for certain games and applications, check the settings of your location spoofer. Within the app settings, you can revert to your actual location. Apart from that, if you are using a VPN to change location, disconnect from it. Upon turning it off, your device will return to the real location.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983588">                    <video width="360" height="150" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983588.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983588">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983588.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983588%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983588/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## The Bottom Line<p>In this guide, you have learned how to <strong>change location on the Apple iPhone 8</strong> in different scenarios.

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 7 Plus?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 7 Plus has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 7 Plus and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 7 Plus user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 7 Plus Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 7 Plus Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 7 Plus.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 7 Plus has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 7 Plus, iPad, or other Apple devices.

Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 7 Plus, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 7 Plus Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 7 Plus Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 7 Plus may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 7 Plus’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 7 Plus] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 7 Plus needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 7 Plus run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 7 Plus provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 7 Plus in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 7 Plus relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 7 Plus is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947746/11832" target="_top" id="947746">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947746" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947746/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: "No Location Found" vs. "Location Not Available" in Find My App<p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

Ideally, a lot of people use GPX files to access a particular route offline when they are off the grid. Though, there are times when users find it hard to view GPX on a map. Don’t worry, there are plenty of ways to view GPX online or offline. In this post, I will let you know how to view GPX in Google Maps and other resourceful desktop applications in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files"><a href="#Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?"></a>Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?</h2><p>Before we discuss how to utilize a GPX view online or offline tool, let’s quickly consider how these files work. It stands for GPS Exchange format and stores map-related data in an XML format. Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.</p><p>From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>Coordinates</strong>: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.</li><li><strong>Routes</strong>: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).</li><li><strong>Tracks</strong>: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg"                      alt="GPX File"                ></p><p>Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948937/19272" target="_top" id="1948937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?<p>The good thing is that there are tons of options to view GPX online on desktop, Android, or iOS platforms.

Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068408/7443" target="_top" id="2068408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068408/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 7 Plus Say, "Location Not Available"?<p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 7 Plus.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 7 Plus has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 7 Plus, iPad, or other Apple devices.

Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 7 Plus] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 7 Plus needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 7 Plus run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 7 Plus provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 7 Plus in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 7 Plus relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 7 Plus is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2024329/7443" target="_top" id="2024329">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2024329" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2024329/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: "No Location Found" vs. "Location Not Available" in Find My App<p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 7?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 7 has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 7 and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 7 user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 7 device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 7 device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 7 device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 7 device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 7 device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135405/19272" target="_top" id="2135405">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135405" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135405/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 7 Say, "Location Not Available"?<p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 7 device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 7 device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 7 device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 7 device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 7 device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 7.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 7 are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 7 has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 7 device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 7 device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 7 device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 7 device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 7 device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 7, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484939/16446" target="_top" id="1484939">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484939" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484939/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: What Does "No Location Found" Mean in Find My App?<p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 7, iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device.

Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 7, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098702/14409" target="_top" id="2098702">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098702" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098702/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118326/7443" target="_top" id="2118326">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118326" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118326/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 7 Say, "No Location Found"?<p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 7 may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 7’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 7] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 7 needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 7 run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 7 device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 7 provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 7 are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 7 device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 7 device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 7 in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 7 relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 7 is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 7. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 7’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them. While both errors involve the inaccessibility of the location services, some causes also display similarities among them. However, there still is a difference in the errors, which is marked by the following table.

Having the correct date and time settings is vital in avoiding issues like “Location Not Available” on your Apple iPhone 7. To prevent this from happening, you have to set the date and time of your Apple iPhone 7, which can be done as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the “Settings” of your Apple iPhone 7 and look for “General” settings in the list of options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-8.jpg"                      alt="access the general option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you lead next, find the “Date &amp; Time” settings in the options to access your Apple iPhone 7’s date and time settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-9.jpg"                      alt="choose the date and time option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You must turn off the toggle adjacent to the “Set Automatically” option.

This fixes all the prevailing glitches within the Apple iPhone 7 device, and it would be best to restart your device. However, the steps for restarting the Apple iPhone 7 differ depending on your model. Let’s look into the instructions to understand the prevailing differences:</p><p><strong>For Apple iPhone 7 with Home Button</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To turn off an Apple iPhone 7 with the Home button, you have to hold the “Power” button on the side.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> This opens a new screen where you have to turn off the Apple iPhone 7 with the slider. As it turns off, use the Power button to start the Apple iPhone 7 again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-11.jpg"                      alt="restart Apple iPhone 7 with the home button"                ></p><p><strong>For Apple iPhone 7 without Home Button</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Apple iPhone 7s without the Home button can be turned off using any “Volume” button and the “Power” button. You have to hold both buttons simultaneously until the slider screen appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-12.jpg"                      alt="turn off Apple iPhone 7 with the home button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you turn off the Apple iPhone 7, you need to wait a few seconds and start the Apple iPhone 7 by holding the Power button for a few seconds.</p><h3 id="Fix-6-Enable-Location-Services-From-Apple-iPhone-7-Settings"><a href="#Fix-6-Enable-Location-Services-From-Apple-iPhone-7-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6: Enable Location Services From Apple iPhone 7 Settings"></a>Fix 6: Enable Location Services From Apple iPhone 7 Settings</h3><p><strong>‘Does “No Location Found” mean they stopped sharing’</strong> might be the question you would seek when you constantly are facing issues with finding a location across the Find My app. This is quite possible as the Location Services across the Apple iPhone 7 might be turned off for no particular reason. To resolve this problem, you have to follow the resolution to this problem with the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the “Settings” application on the Apple iPhone 7 and proceed into the “Privacy &amp; Security” settings available in the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-13.jpg"                      alt="choose privacy and security option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you lead into the next screen, find “Location Services” among the options. On accessing the “Location Services” settings, ensure that the toggle adjacent to the “Location Services” option is turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-14.jpg"                      alt="enable the location services option"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075483/7443" target="_top" id="2075483">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075483" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075483/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Fix 7: Turning On Precise Location on Apple iPhone 7<p>As location issues across the Apple iPhone 7 involve the location settings, you can also look into the “Precise Location” option for resolving the prevailing problems of the Apple iPhone 7. To execute this properly and avoid all pertinent issues that are preventing you from getting a proper location across Find My, you must follow the steps to turn on Precise Location on your Apple iPhone 7:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You must open the “Settings” of your Apple iPhone 7 and search for the “Privacy &amp; Security” option within the menu. Next, redirect to the “Location Services” section and turn it on with the available toggle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-15.jpg"                      alt="select the privacy and security option"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925549/19272" target="_top" id="1925549">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925549" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925549/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->**Step 2:** Following this, you need to scroll down in the same section and look for "Find My" in the options.

Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 7 device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 7 device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993651">                    <video width="80" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993651">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993651%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993651/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975807/19272" target="_top" id="1975807">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975807" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975807/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 7 Say, "Location Not Available"?<p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 7 device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 7 device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 7 device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 7 device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 7 device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 7.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 7 are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 7 has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 7 device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 7 device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 7 device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 7 device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 7 device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 7, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982508">                    <video width="360" height="150" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982508">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982508%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982508/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: What Does "No Location Found" Mean in Find My App?<p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 7, iPad, or other Apple devices.

Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 7, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1304648">                    <video width="125" height="125" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304648.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1304648">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304648.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1304648%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1304648/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105864/7443" target="_top" id="2105864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 7 Say, "No Location Found"?<p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 7 may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 7’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 7] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 7 needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 7 run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 7 device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 7 provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 7 are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 7 device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 7 device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 7 in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 7 relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 7 is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 7. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 7’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1175223/12108" target="_top" id="1175223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1175223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1175223/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: "No Location Found" vs. "Location Not Available" in Find My App<p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 6s Plus?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 6s Plus has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 6s Plus and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 6s Plus user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Plus Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Plus Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 6s Plus.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device. However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><h3 id="2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error"><a href="#2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error"></a>2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error</h3><p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 6s Plus, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Plus Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Plus Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 6s Plus may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 6s Plus’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 6s Plus] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 6s Plus needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 6s Plus run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 6s Plus provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 6s Plus are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 6s Plus in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 6s Plus relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 6s Plus. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them. While both errors involve the inaccessibility of the location services, some causes also display similarities among them. However, there still is a difference in the errors, which is marked by the following table. With the presented distinctions, you can specify the <strong>difference between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available.”</strong></p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GwoQIMj7kzY"></iframe><p><em>Fake GPS Location on iOS and Android in One Click!</em></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880944/19272" target="_top" id="1880944">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880944" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880944/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### What is the Difference Between Location Unavailable and No Location Found?<table><thead><tr><th><strong>No Location Found</strong></th><th><strong>Location Not Available &#x2F; Location Unavailable</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Occurs when Apple iPhone 6s Plus is turned off or is offline</td><td>The Find My App is turned on but is failing to update the user’s current location.</td></tr><tr><td>The device will be blank in color.</td><td>The device will have a color and will not be generic.</td></tr><tr><td>Location Services across the Apple iPhone 6s Plus might not be turned on.</td><td>The “Location Services” and “Share My Location” features on Apple iPhone 6s Plus are active and running.</td></tr><tr><td>It does not update the location of the person in seconds.</td><td>The location is updated within seconds once the service is resumed.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In summary, “Location not available” typically refers to the temporary unavailability of location data from a device, while “No location found” indicates the inability to locate a specific device or individual at the given time.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Fix-“No-Location-Found”-or-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Fix-“No-Location-Found”-or-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Fix “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” in Find My App?"></a>Part 4: How to Fix “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” in Find My App?</h2><p>We shall now start with an overview of the fixes that can be utilized to resolve the location errors in the Find My App. While the provided solutions are pretty comprehensive, different solutions can be appropriate for both problems.

Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-Say-“Location-Not-Available”-1"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-Say-“Location-Not-Available”-1" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Plus Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Plus Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 6s Plus.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, iPad, or other Apple devices.

In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 6s Plus’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 6s Plus] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 6s Plus needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 6s Plus run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 6s Plus provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 6s Plus are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 6s Plus in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 6s Plus relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 6s Plus. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098702/14409" target="_top" id="2098702">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098702" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098702/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: "No Location Found" vs. "Location Not Available" in Find My App<p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 6s Plus&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 6s Plus or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925473/19272" target="_top" id="1925473">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925473" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925473/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++<p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon.

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 6s?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 6s has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 6s and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 6s user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 6s device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 6s device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 6s device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 6s device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 6s device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1498635">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1498635.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1498635">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1498635.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:200px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fancheer.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1498635%2F17326'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1498635/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Say, "Location Not Available"?<p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 6s device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 6s device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 6s device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 6s device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 6s device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 6s.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 6s are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 6s has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 6s device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 6s device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 6s device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 6s device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 6s device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 6s, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 6s, iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device. However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><h3 id="2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error"><a href="#2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error"></a>2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error</h3><p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone 6s is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 6s, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993645">                    <video width="360" height="150" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993645.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993645">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993645.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993645%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993645/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Say, "No Location Found"?<p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 6s may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 6s’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 6s] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 6s needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 6s run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 6s device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 6s provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 6s are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 6s device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 6s device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 6s in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 6s relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 6s is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 6s. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved.

This fixes all the prevailing glitches within the Apple iPhone 6s device, and it would be best to restart your device. However, the steps for restarting the Apple iPhone 6s differ depending on your model. Let’s look into the instructions to understand the prevailing differences:</p><p><strong>For Apple iPhone 6s with Home Button</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To turn off an Apple iPhone 6s with the Home button, you have to hold the “Power” button on the side.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> This opens a new screen where you have to turn off the Apple iPhone 6s with the slider. As it turns off, use the Power button to start the Apple iPhone 6s again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-11.jpg"                      alt="restart Apple iPhone 6s with the home button"                ></p><p><strong>For Apple iPhone 6s without Home Button</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Apple iPhone 6ss without the Home button can be turned off using any “Volume” button and the “Power” button.

While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 6s and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1167086/14483" target="_top" id="1167086">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1167086" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://electronicx.pxf.io/i/5597632/1167086/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean in Find My App?<p>If you are an Apple iPhone 6s user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 6s device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error-1"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error-1" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 6s device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 6s device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 6s device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 6s device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082542/7443" target="_top" id="2082542">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082542" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082542/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Say, "Location Not Available"?<p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 6s device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 6s device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 6s device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 6s device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 6s device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 6s.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 6s are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 6s has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 6s device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 6s device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 6s device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 6s device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 6s device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 6s, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043618/7443" target="_top" id="2043618">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043618" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043618/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: What Does "No Location Found" Mean in Find My App?<p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 6s, iPad, or other Apple devices.

Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 6s, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1172027/12108" target="_top" id="1172027">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1172027" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1172027/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Say, "No Location Found"?<p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 6s may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 6s’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 6s] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 6s needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 6s run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 6s device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 6s provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 6s are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 6s device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 6s device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 6s in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 6s relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 6s is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 6s. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 6s’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2024338/7443" target="_top" id="2024338">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2024338" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2024338/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: "No Location Found" vs. "Location Not Available" in Find My App<p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 6 Plus?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 6 Plus has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 6 Plus and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 6 Plus user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6 Plus Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6 Plus Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 6 Plus.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 6 Plus are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 6 Plus has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 6 Plus, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, iPad, or other Apple devices.

However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><h3 id="2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error"><a href="#2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error"></a>2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error</h3><p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone 6 Plus is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 6 Plus, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080317/19272" target="_top" id="2080317">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080317" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080317/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/994842/11832" target="_top" id="994842">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-994842" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/994842/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6 Plus Say, "No Location Found"?<p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 6 Plus may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 6 Plus’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 6 Plus] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 6 Plus needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 6 Plus run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 6 Plus provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 6 Plus are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 6 Plus in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 6 Plus relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 6 Plus is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 6 Plus. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016170/19272" target="_top" id="2016170">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016170" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016170/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: "No Location Found" vs. "Location Not Available" in Find My App<p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 6?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 6 has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 6 and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 6 user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 6 device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 6 device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 6 device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 6 device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 6 device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6 Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6 Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 6 device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 6 device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 6 device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 6 device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 6 device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 6.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 6 are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 6 has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 6 device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 6 device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 6 device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 6 device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 6 device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 6, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 6, iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device. However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047366/19272" target="_top" id="2047366">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047366" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047366/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.1 Understanding the "No Location Found" Error<p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone 6 is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 6, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6 Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6 Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 6 may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 6’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 6] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 6 needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 6 run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 6 device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 6 provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 6 are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 6 device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 6 device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 6 in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 6 relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 6 is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 6. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 6’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037475/7443" target="_top" id="2037475">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037475" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: "No Location Found" vs. "Location Not Available" in Find My App<p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device. However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094415/7443" target="_top" id="2094415">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094415" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094415/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.1 Understanding the "No Location Found" Error<p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity.

Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Find-My-App-Troubleshooting-‘No-Location-Found’-vs-‘Location-Not-Available’-How-to-Fix-Them-On-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro"><a href="#Find-My-App-Troubleshooting-‘No-Location-Found’-vs-‘Location-Not-Available’-How-to-Fix-Them-On-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Find My App Troubleshooting: ‘No Location Found’ vs. ‘Location Not Available’ &amp; How to Fix Them On Apple iPhone 15 Pro"></a>Find My App Troubleshooting: ‘No Location Found’ vs. ‘Location Not Available’ &amp; How to Fix Them On Apple iPhone 15 Pro</h2><p><em>“What does it mean when someone’s location on Apple iPhone 15 Pro suddenly shows “Location Not Available”? Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 15 Pro has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 15 Pro and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 15 Pro user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 15 Pro.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information.

In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 15 Pro] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 15 Pro needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 15 Pro run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 15 Pro provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983474">                    <video width="360" height="150" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983474">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983474%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983474/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: "No Location Found" vs. "Location Not Available" in Find My App<p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

Now, tap on the “My Info” option to view your details like name, email, address, and so on. Just go to the “Address” field and manually enter your new address to change it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/change-home-address-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="change home address Apple iPhone 15 Pro 7"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105874/7443" target="_top" id="2105874">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105874" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105874/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: How to Change Home Address in Google Maps on Apple iPhone 15 Pro?<p>While Apple Maps is the native navigation application in Apple iPhone 15 Pro, a lot of people also prefer using Google Maps.

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 15 Plus?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 15 Plus has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 15 Plus and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 15 Plus user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Plus Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Plus Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 15 Plus.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device. However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2030375/7443" target="_top" id="2030375">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2030375" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2030375/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.1 Understanding the "No Location Found" Error<p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 15 Plus, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047411/19272" target="_top" id="2047411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047411/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Plus Say, "No Location Found"?<p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 15 Plus may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 15 Plus’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 15 Plus] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 15 Plus needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 15 Plus run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 15 Plus provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 15 Plus are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 15 Plus in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 15 Plus relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 15 Plus. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983471">                    <video width="360" height="150" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983471%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983471/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: "No Location Found" vs. "Location Not Available" in Find My App<p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them. While both errors involve the inaccessibility of the location services, some causes also display similarities among them. However, there still is a difference in the errors, which is marked by the following table. With the presented distinctions, you can specify the <strong>difference between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available.”</strong></p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GwoQIMj7kzY"></iframe><p><em>Fake GPS Location on iOS and Android in One Click!</em></p><h3 id="What-is-the-Difference-Between-Location-Unavailable-and-No-Location-Found"><a href="#What-is-the-Difference-Between-Location-Unavailable-and-No-Location-Found" class="headerlink" title="What is the Difference Between Location Unavailable and No Location Found?"></a>What is the Difference Between Location Unavailable and No Location Found?</h3><table><thead><tr><th><strong>No Location Found</strong></th><th><strong>Location Not Available &#x2F; Location Unavailable</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Occurs when Apple iPhone 15 Plus is turned off or is offline</td><td>The Find My App is turned on but is failing to update the user’s current location.</td></tr><tr><td>The device will be blank in color.</td><td>The device will have a color and will not be generic.</td></tr><tr><td>Location Services across the Apple iPhone 15 Plus might not be turned on.</td><td>The “Location Services” and “Share My Location” features on Apple iPhone 15 Plus are active and running.</td></tr><tr><td>It does not update the location of the person in seconds.</td><td>The location is updated within seconds once the service is resumed.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In summary, “Location not available” typically refers to the temporary unavailability of location data from a device, while “No location found” indicates the inability to locate a specific device or individual at the given time.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Fix-“No-Location-Found”-or-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Fix-“No-Location-Found”-or-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Fix “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” in Find My App?"></a>Part 4: How to Fix “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” in Find My App?</h2><p>We shall now start with an overview of the fixes that can be utilized to resolve the location errors in the Find My App. While the provided solutions are pretty comprehensive, different solutions can be appropriate for both problems. Thus, keep a check on the fixes and select the best option that suits your nature.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Checking-the-Apple’s-System-Status-Page"><a href="#Fix-1-Checking-the-Apple’s-System-Status-Page" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Checking the Apple’s System Status Page"></a>Fix 1: Checking the Apple’s System Status Page</h3><p>The first thing you can do to check the location problems across the Apple iPhone 15 Plus is to look into the status of Find My across Apple servers through <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/" >Apple’s System Status <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> page.

User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location<p>One of the best indicators of an online tool’s efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics. We did not thoroughly enjoy using the iTools Virtual Location ourselves. And that is because it does not include advanced features as the iTools Virtual Location alternatives mentioned here. Nevertheless, it is also good to look at other users’ feedback, so here are a few reviews from iTools users:</p><p><strong>Sri Viswakarma (Content Manager, Greenland LLC.)</strong></p><p><strong>Ratings: 4.8&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**I recently started using the iTools Virtual Location application, and I am impressed that it delivers on its promise. The price is quite high compared to other GPS location changes in the market, but during the Trial version of the tool, iTool’s simple interface stuck with me. It’s reliable, and I love how it lets me access location-restricted content. I recommend the iTools Virtual Location to anyone looking to change their GPS location on their Apple iPhone 15 Plus conveniently.”</p><p><strong>Kat Napiorkowska (Self-employed)</strong></p><p><strong>Rating: 2.3&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**After reading the good description of the iTools Virtual Location from the vendor, I was really excited to try the application. But I have to say that I am quite disappointed with iTools Virtual Location. I was really excited to try iTools Virtual Location, but I have to say I am quite disappointed with the app. In my opinion, the application’s user interface is quite confusing, and I found it difficult to navigate. I also experienced some bugs and crashes while using the app, which was frustrating. The location-changing feature didn’t seem to work well for me, as the new location wasn’t accurate or consistent. I was hoping for a reliable and efficient tool, but unfortunately, iTools Virtual Location did not meet my expectations. I would not recommend this app to others.”</p><h2 id="Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-iTools-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-iTools-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 15?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 15 has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 15 and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 15 user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 15 device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 15 device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 15 device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 15 device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 15 device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1576477/17382" target="_top" id="1576477">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1576477" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1576477/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Say, "Location Not Available"?<p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 15 device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 15 device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 15 device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 15 device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 15 device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 15.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 15 are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 15 has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 15 device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 15 device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 15 device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 15 device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 15 device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 15, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 15, iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device. However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><h3 id="2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error"><a href="#2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error"></a>2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error</h3><p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone 15 is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 15, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982508">                    <video width="360" height="150" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982508">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982508%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982508/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Say, "No Location Found"?<p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 15 may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 15’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 15] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 15 needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 15 run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 15 device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 15 provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 15 are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 15 device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 15 device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 15 in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 15 relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6.

Just open Apple Maps and select any location of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/change-home-address-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="change home address Apple iPhone 15 5"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943647/22993" target="_top" id="1943647">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943647" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943647/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->Step 6.

For instance, if you use Safari, then you might be familiar with the autofill feature. While filling a form in Safari, it would automatically detect the fields and will enter the relevant information on its own. Therefore, if you have changed your home address on Maps, then it is recommended to reflect that on Safari as well. In this way, the application can enter your changed address while autofilling a form. Here’s a simple tweak that you can do to change home address in Apple iPhone 15 autofill.</p><p>Step 1. Firstly, you need to follow the above-mentioned drill and go to your own contact card to change your home address.</p><p>Step 2. Once you have changed your home address in contacts, just go to your Apple iPhone 15’s Settings &gt; Safari and tap on the “Autofill” option under the General section.</p><p>Step 3. Here, you can view details related to the automatic filling of contacts, names, passwords, credit cards, etc. Firstly, make sure that the option to autofill contacts info is enabled.</p><p>Step 4. Now, tap on the “My Info” option to view your details like name, email, address, and so on. Just go to the “Address” field and manually enter your new address to change it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/change-home-address-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="change home address Apple iPhone 15 7"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880944/19272" target="_top" id="1880944">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880944" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880944/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: How to Change Home Address in Google Maps on Apple iPhone 15?<p>While Apple Maps is the native navigation application in Apple iPhone 15, a lot of people also prefer using Google Maps. Already used by over a billion people worldwide, Google Maps is the most popular and reliable navigation app in the world that runs on Android and Apple iPhone 15 alike. Though, unlike Apple Maps, Google Maps lets us save our home, work, or any other addresses in the app itself. In this way, you can easily share your address with others and select your home address for commuting. To learn how to change home address on Apple iPhone 15’s Google Maps app, just follow these steps:</p><p>Step 1. To start with, just unlock your Apple iPhone 15 and launch the Google Maps application on it. Beforehand, make sure that you are connected to a stable internet connection.</p><p>Step 2. Once Google Maps is launched, tap on the hamburger icon at the top-left corner to get more options (like your places, timeline, and more). From here, just tap on the “Your Places” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/change-home-address-iphone-8.jpg"                      alt="change home address Apple iPhone 15 8"                ></p><p>Step 3. This will list out all the saved addresses on the screen like your home, work, etc. To add or change your home address, you can just tap on the “Home” field here.</p><p>Step 4. Now, all you got to do is tap on the search bar and enter your home address so that Google Maps would automatically load it. You can also tap on the “Choose on Map” field to find the home address easily on Google Maps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/change-home-address-iphone-9.jpg"                      alt="change home address Apple iPhone 15 9"                ></p><p>Step 5. That’s it! You can now save the changes you have made and review them whenever you want. To make any changes to it, you can just tap on the three-dot icon adjacent to the Home button. This will let you edit your home address, remove it, and add directions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/change-home-address-iphone-10.jpg"                      alt="change home address Apple iPhone 15 10"                ></p><p>That’s a wrap, everyone! I’m sure that after reading this guide you would be able to change home address on Apple iPhone 15 like a pro. To make things easier for you, I have come up with a step-by-step tutorial on how to change home address on Apple iPhone 15 via Apple Maps as well as Google Maps. Furthermore, I have also listed a smart solution to change your address in Safari’s autofill to save your time. Well, this is what I did when I wanted to know how do I change my home address on Apple iPhone 15 a while back. You can follow this drill and share this guide with others to teach them the same.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105877/7443" target="_top" id="2105877">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105877" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105877/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Dr.Fone -

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880960/19272" target="_top" id="1880960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880960/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: What Does "No Location Found" Mean in Find My App?<p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device. However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068426/7443" target="_top" id="2068426">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068426" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068426/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.1 Understanding the "No Location Found" Error<p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037346/7443" target="_top" id="2037346">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037346" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037346/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Say, "No Location Found"?<p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006960/19272" target="_top" id="2006960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006960/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: "No Location Found" vs. "Location Not Available" in Find My App<p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 14 Pro?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 14 Pro has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 14 Pro and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 14 Pro user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 14 Pro.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130891/7443" target="_top" id="2130891">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130891" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130891/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: What Does "No Location Found" Mean in Find My App?<p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device. However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><h3 id="2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error"><a href="#2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error"></a>2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error</h3><p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 14 Pro, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983553">                    <video width="360" height="150" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983553">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983553%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983553/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Say, "No Location Found"?<p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 14 Pro may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 14 Pro’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 14 Pro] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 14 Pro needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 14 Pro run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 14 Pro provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 14 Pro are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 14 Pro in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7.

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 14 Plus?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 14 Plus has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 14 Plus and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 14 Plus user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1576477/17382" target="_top" id="1576477">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1576477" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1576477/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Plus Say, "Location Not Available"?<p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 14 Plus has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6.

However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094480/7443" target="_top" id="2094480">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094480" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094480/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Plus Say, "No Location Found"?<p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 14 Plus may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 14 Plus’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 14 Plus] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 14 Plus needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 14 Plus run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 14 Plus provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 14 Plus are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 14 Plus in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 14 Plus relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 14 Plus is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 14 Plus. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them. While both errors involve the inaccessibility of the location services, some causes also display similarities among them. However, there still is a difference in the errors, which is marked by the following table. With the presented distinctions, you can specify the <strong>difference between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available.”</strong></p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GwoQIMj7kzY"></iframe><p><em>Fake GPS Location on iOS and Android in One Click!</em></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915830/19272" target="_top" id="1915830">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915830" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915830/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### What is the Difference Between Location Unavailable and No Location Found?<table><thead><tr><th><strong>No Location Found</strong></th><th><strong>Location Not Available &#x2F; Location Unavailable</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Occurs when Apple iPhone 14 Plus is turned off or is offline</td><td>The Find My App is turned on but is failing to update the user’s current location.</td></tr><tr><td>The device will be blank in color.</td><td>The device will have a color and will not be generic.</td></tr><tr><td>Location Services across the Apple iPhone 14 Plus might not be turned on.</td><td>The “Location Services” and “Share My Location” features on Apple iPhone 14 Plus are active and running.</td></tr><tr><td>It does not update the location of the person in seconds.</td><td>The location is updated within seconds once the service is resumed.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In summary, “Location not available” typically refers to the temporary unavailability of location data from a device, while “No location found” indicates the inability to locate a specific device or individual at the given time.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Fix-“No-Location-Found”-or-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Fix-“No-Location-Found”-or-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Fix “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” in Find My App?"></a>Part 4: How to Fix “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” in Find My App?</h2><p>We shall now start with an overview of the fixes that can be utilized to resolve the location errors in the Find My App. While the provided solutions are pretty comprehensive, different solutions can be appropriate for both problems.

Ideally, a lot of people use GPX files to access a particular route offline when they are off the grid. Though, there are times when users find it hard to view GPX on a map. Don’t worry, there are plenty of ways to view GPX online or offline. In this post, I will let you know how to view GPX in Google Maps and other resourceful desktop applications in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files"><a href="#Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?"></a>Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?</h2><p>Before we discuss how to utilize a GPX view online or offline tool, let’s quickly consider how these files work. It stands for GPS Exchange format and stores map-related data in an XML format. Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.</p><p>From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>Coordinates</strong>: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.</li><li><strong>Routes</strong>: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).</li><li><strong>Tracks</strong>: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg"                      alt="GPX File"                ></p><p>Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?"></a>Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?</h2><p>The good thing is that there are tons of options to view GPX online on desktop, Android, or iOS platforms. Some of these freely available solutions to view GPX on Map are Google Earth, Google Maps, Bing Maps, Garmin BaseCamp, GPX Viewer, and so on.</p><p>Out of them, Google Maps is one of the most used solutions to view GPX online on smartphones and desktops alike. As of now, you can import GPX files in the KML format or even load CSV files of exact coordinates on Google Maps. To learn how to view GPX in Google Maps, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to Your Places in Google Maps</strong></p><p>To view GPX on the map, you can first head to the official website of Google Maps on your computer.

Why does it say no location found on Find My Apple iPhone 14?”</em></p><p>On Quora, there are many similar questions as above. Do you have the same question?</p><p>The Find My app on Apple iPhone 14 has become a powerful tool for locating lost or misplaced devices and tracking the location of family and friends. While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 14 and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 14 user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 14 device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 14 device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 14 device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 14 device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 14 device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-14-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-14-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 14 device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 14 device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 14 device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 14 device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 14 device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 14.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 14 are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 14 has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 14 device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 14 device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 14 device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 14 device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 14 device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 14, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 14, iPad, or other Apple devices. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to pinpoint the exact location of your device. However, there are instances where the app fails to provide a location, leaving users confused and concerned.</p><h3 id="2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error"><a href="#2-1-Understanding-the-“No-Location-Found”-Error" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error"></a>2.1 Understanding the “No Location Found” Error</h3><p>The “No Location Found” error message on your Find My app indicates that your Apple iPhone 14 is unable to determine its current location. Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 14, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132162/7443" target="_top" id="2132162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132162/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075472/7443" target="_top" id="2075472">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075472" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075472/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 14 Say, "No Location Found"?<p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 14 may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 14’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 14] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 14 needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 14 run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 14 device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 14 provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 14 are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 14 device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 14 device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 14 in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 14 relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 14 is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 14. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 14’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them. While both errors involve the inaccessibility of the location services, some causes also display similarities among them. However, there still is a difference in the errors, which is marked by the following table.

Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone 14 or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.</p><p>When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 14 device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.</p><p>All we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to <strong>change location on Apple iPhone 14</strong>, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?"></a>Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?</h2><p>Step 1: On your Apple iPhone 14, go to the App Store app.</p><p>Step 2: Click on the “Featured” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/featured-tab-app-store.jpg"                      alt="featured tab app store"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, scroll down to locate your Apple id and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/locate-apple-id-app-store.jpg"                      alt="locate apple id app store"                ></p><p>Step 4: Choose “View Apple ID”.

Now, look for “Privacy” option and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-completely-1.jpg"                      alt="disable location"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902309/19272" target="_top" id="1902309">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902309" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902309/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->**Step 2:** Now, go for the “Location Services” and tap on it.<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-completely-2.jpg"                      alt="Location Services"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Slide the switch next to “Location Services” to turn the locations off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-completely-3.jpg"                      alt="use the switch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1166360/14483" target="_top" id="1166360">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1166360" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://electronicx.pxf.io/i/5597632/1166360/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Method 3: Disable location tracking of specific apps<p>In the above section, you have stopped tracking on Apple iPhone 14 entirely which means any of the location based app or service won’t be able to locate you. Nevertheless, completely turning it off can sometimes be useless as there are some apps that need the tracking of your location so as to give you better experience. As a solution for this, you can follow the steps below and can turn off location for specific apps only. Here is how to stop tracking on Apple iPhone 14 for specific apps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open “Settings” as usual firstly and go to “Privacy”.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to “Location Services” and don’t toggle it off. Instead, you will find apps listed under the option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the apps and make adjustments according to your preferences. You can choose among “Never”, “While Using the App” and “Always”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/disable-location-specific-apps.jpg"                      alt="make adjustments"                ></p><p>The first option will never send your location to the apps. Second option will use your location only when you use the particular app. And as it suggests itself, by choosing the “Always” option will always track your location.</p><h2 id="Method-4-Disable-Significant-Locations-on-Apple-iPhone-14"><a href="#Method-4-Disable-Significant-Locations-on-Apple-iPhone-14" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Disable Significant Locations on Apple iPhone 14"></a>Method 4: Disable Significant Locations on Apple iPhone 14</h2><p>Apart from the apps, Apple iPhone 14 itself keeps record of where you travel the most.
