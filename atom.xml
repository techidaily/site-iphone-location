Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 6 device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 6 device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6 Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6 Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 6 device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 6 device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 6 device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 6 device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 6 device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 6.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 6 are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 6 has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 6 device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 6 device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 6 device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 6 device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 6 device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 6, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 6, iPad, or other Apple devices.

Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 6, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6 Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6 Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 6 may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 6’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 6] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 6 needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 6 run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 6 device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 6 provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 6 are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 6 device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 6 device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 6 in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 6 relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 6 is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 6. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 6’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

For instance, if you use Safari, then you might be familiar with the autofill feature. While filling a form in Safari, it would automatically detect the fields and will enter the relevant information on its own. Therefore, if you have changed your home address on Maps, then it is recommended to reflect that on Safari as well. In this way, the application can enter your changed address while autofilling a form. Here’s a simple tweak that you can do to change home address in Apple iPhone 7 autofill.</p><p>Step 1. Firstly, you need to follow the above-mentioned drill and go to your own contact card to change your home address.</p><p>Step 2. Once you have changed your home address in contacts, just go to your Apple iPhone 7’s Settings &gt; Safari and tap on the “Autofill” option under the General section.</p><p>Step 3. Here, you can view details related to the automatic filling of contacts, names, passwords, credit cards, etc. Firstly, make sure that the option to autofill contacts info is enabled.</p><p>Step 4. Now, tap on the “My Info” option to view your details like name, email, address, and so on. Just go to the “Address” field and manually enter your new address to change it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/change-home-address-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="change home address Apple iPhone 7 7"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Home-Address-in-Google-Maps-on-Apple-iPhone-7"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Home-Address-in-Google-Maps-on-Apple-iPhone-7" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Home Address in Google Maps on Apple iPhone 7?"></a>Part 3: How to Change Home Address in Google Maps on Apple iPhone 7?</h2><p>While Apple Maps is the native navigation application in Apple iPhone 7, a lot of people also prefer using Google Maps. Already used by over a billion people worldwide, Google Maps is the most popular and reliable navigation app in the world that runs on Android and Apple iPhone 7 alike. Though, unlike Apple Maps, Google Maps lets us save our home, work, or any other addresses in the app itself. In this way, you can easily share your address with others and select your home address for commuting. To learn how to change home address on Apple iPhone 7’s Google Maps app, just follow these steps:</p><p>Step 1. To start with, just unlock your Apple iPhone 7 and launch the Google Maps application on it. Beforehand, make sure that you are connected to a stable internet connection.</p><p>Step 2. Once Google Maps is launched, tap on the hamburger icon at the top-left corner to get more options (like your places, timeline, and more). From here, just tap on the “Your Places” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/change-home-address-iphone-8.jpg"                      alt="change home address Apple iPhone 7 8"                ></p><p>Step 3. This will list out all the saved addresses on the screen like your home, work, etc. To add or change your home address, you can just tap on the “Home” field here.</p><p>Step 4. Now, all you got to do is tap on the search bar and enter your home address so that Google Maps would automatically load it. You can also tap on the “Choose on Map” field to find the home address easily on Google Maps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/change-home-address-iphone-9.jpg"                      alt="change home address Apple iPhone 7 9"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123509/26400" target="_top" id="2123509">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123509" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123509/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 5.

Ideally, a lot of people use GPX files to access a particular route offline when they are off the grid. Though, there are times when users find it hard to view GPX on a map. Don’t worry, there are plenty of ways to view GPX online or offline. In this post, I will let you know how to view GPX in Google Maps and other resourceful desktop applications in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files"><a href="#Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?"></a>Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?</h2><p>Before we discuss how to utilize a GPX view online or offline tool, let’s quickly consider how these files work. It stands for GPS Exchange format and stores map-related data in an XML format. Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.</p><p>From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>Coordinates</strong>: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.</li><li><strong>Routes</strong>: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).</li><li><strong>Tracks</strong>: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg"                      alt="GPX File"                ></p><p>Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?"></a>Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?</h2><p>The good thing is that there are tons of options to view GPX online on desktop, Android, or iOS platforms.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-and-Offline-Solutions-Of-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus"><a href="#How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-and-Offline-Solutions-Of-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus" class="headerlink" title="How to View GPX Files: Online and Offline Solutions Of Apple iPhone 6 Plus"></a>How to View GPX Files: Online and Offline Solutions Of Apple iPhone 6 Plus</h2><p>Also known as GPS Exchange Format, GPX is one of the most resourceful file types that is used to store and import&#x2F;export map-related data. Ideally, a lot of people use GPX files to access a particular route offline when they are off the grid. Though, there are times when users find it hard to view GPX on a map. Don’t worry, there are plenty of ways to view GPX online or offline. In this post, I will let you know how to view GPX in Google Maps and other resourceful desktop applications in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files"><a href="#Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?"></a>Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?</h2><p>Before we discuss how to utilize a GPX view online or offline tool, let’s quickly consider how these files work. It stands for GPS Exchange format and stores map-related data in an XML format. Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.</p><p>From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>Coordinates</strong>: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.</li><li><strong>Routes</strong>: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).</li><li><strong>Tracks</strong>: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg"                      alt="GPX File"                ></p><p>Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?"></a>Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?</h2><p>The good thing is that there are tons of options to view GPX online on desktop, Android, or iOS platforms. Some of these freely available solutions to view GPX on Map are Google Earth, Google Maps, Bing Maps, Garmin BaseCamp, GPX Viewer, and so on.</p><p>Out of them, Google Maps is one of the most used solutions to view GPX online on smartphones and desktops alike. As of now, you can import GPX files in the KML format or even load CSV files of exact coordinates on Google Maps. To learn how to view GPX in Google Maps, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to Your Places in Google Maps</strong></p><p>To view GPX on the map, you can first head to the official website of Google Maps on your computer.

From here, you can just click on the “Your Places” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-4.jpg"                      alt="Google Maps Your Places"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose to Create a New Map</strong></p><p>As a dedicated section of “Your Places” would be launched, you can view all the saved places for your Google Maps account.

Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.</p><p>When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device.

Is there a risk of my account being banned in certain apps or games if I change my location?</strong></p><p>Yes, you might encounter issues in certain apps if you change location on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. This is because some apps have terms that prohibit falsifying locations. If they observe a rapid change in location due to VPN, it could lead to a ban to maintain fair play.

How do I change my location back to my real one?</strong></p><p>If you have faked your location on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max for certain games and applications, check the settings of your location spoofer.

You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 12 Pro&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 12 Pro or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon.

Ideally, a lot of people use GPX files to access a particular route offline when they are off the grid. Though, there are times when users find it hard to view GPX on a map. Don’t worry, there are plenty of ways to view GPX online or offline. In this post, I will let you know how to view GPX in Google Maps and other resourceful desktop applications in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files"><a href="#Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?"></a>Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?</h2><p>Before we discuss how to utilize a GPX view online or offline tool, let’s quickly consider how these files work. It stands for GPS Exchange format and stores map-related data in an XML format. Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.</p><p>From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>Coordinates</strong>: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.</li><li><strong>Routes</strong>: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).</li><li><strong>Tracks</strong>: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg"                      alt="GPX File"                ></p><p>Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?"></a>Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?</h2><p>The good thing is that there are tons of options to view GPX online on desktop, Android, or iOS platforms. Some of these freely available solutions to view GPX on Map are Google Earth, Google Maps, Bing Maps, Garmin BaseCamp, GPX Viewer, and so on.</p><p>Out of them, Google Maps is one of the most used solutions to view GPX online on smartphones and desktops alike. As of now, you can import GPX files in the KML format or even load CSV files of exact coordinates on Google Maps. To learn how to view GPX in Google Maps, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to Your Places in Google Maps</strong></p><p>To view GPX on the map, you can first head to the official website of Google Maps on your computer.

While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.</p><p>One such cheat&#x2F;hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pokego"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pokego" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Pokego++?"></a>Part 1: What is Pokego++?</h2><p>If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134493/18498" target="_top" id="2134493">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134493" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134493/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon.

Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo-1"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo-1"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon.

I tested the ultra-affordable AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna for a week to see if its design, setup, and performance make it a viable option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2145079/17095" target="_top" id="2145079">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17095-2145079" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/i/5597632/2145079/17095"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic"><a href="#Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic" class="headerlink" title="Design: It’s all in the name (basic)"></a><strong>Design: It’s all in the name (basic)</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna has a slim design—it’s about as thin as card stock at approximately one-tenth of an inch in thickness. It’s constructed of sturdy plastic, with a reversible black and white side to help it fit better with your home’s decor. It’s not the most attractive antenna, and the backboards smudge and show grease and fingerprints.</p><p> It doesn’t come with a stand, but it does include 3M double-sided adhesives you can use to attach the antenna to walls or other surfaces. It also comes with a 10-foot long coax cable, which is removable. The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><p> The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><h2 id="Setup-Relatively-easy"><a href="#Setup-Relatively-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Relatively easy"></a><strong>Setup: Relatively easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the antenna is pretty straightforward. You start by plugging one end of the coaxial cable into the antenna, and then the other end to the coaxial&#x2F;antenna-in connector to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Finding the best placement for the antenna is perhaps the most difficult part, as a few inches can make a difference in your available channel selection. My test home is under a canopy of trees in a pretty rural area, and I found the best placement was on the window. Ideally, you’ll want to direct the antenna towards tower transmitters, while also doing your best to reduce obstacles (think trees, electrical interference, and walls). You’ll want to place the antenna high up as well.</p><p> Next, you change your TV to the correct input (usually TV, antenna, or Coax). Then, go to your TV’s menus and start the auto-programming process, which<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >scans for available channels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The process takes a few minutes, and sometimes your TV won’t start to locate channels until about halfway through the auto-programming process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/z_YIDnD2uHBFyEpRQlkQ1HUaA_8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-2-e19a3a09a82f438d8f902ded5b0fecd4.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area"><a href="#Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)"></a><strong>Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)</strong></h2><p> So many things<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >affect an antenna’s performance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —location, household electronics, tree cover, tower location, and more. The antenna displays channels of high quality. However, sometimes the channels would take a few seconds to load, and other times, I’d see a pixelated effect when I first changed the channel that would clear up after a few seconds. Once the picture was fully loaded, it was in clear high definition. The antenna is capable of displaying a clear HD picture, so I couldn’t tell the difference between the antenna’s picture and the picture from streaming services like Hulu or Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GRXmDZjwX-_X2TyOZoHytHKrjDY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-3-70b77c023b7049ef985c61cf6f5064ad.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/2106658/12108" target="_top" id="2106658">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-2106658" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/2106658/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-35-miles"><a href="#Range-35-miles" class="headerlink" title="Range: 35 miles"></a><strong>Range: 35 miles</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics antenna has a 35-mile range, which isn’t very far considering 50 plus miles is becoming more common. It is omnidirectional, however, so you don’t need to point it in a specific direction. It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><p> Even with the short-range, I was able to pick up 16 channels on my first attempt, including The CW, PBS, and more. In a different room in my test home, I was able to get 23 channels, but this is probably because there’s less tree cover outside of the house on that side of the property. Considering the location of my test home, 23 channels is pretty good.</p><p> It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><h2 id="Price-Super-affordable"><a href="#Price-Super-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Super affordable"></a><strong>Price: Super affordable</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Flat TV antenna sells in used condition on Amazon for only $13. In new condition, it sells for $20, which is still a great deal. However, you can find other affordable antennas for between $20 and $50 that provide a much longer range, and many offer additional features, like a longer cable. With the AmazonBasics model, you can return the unit within 30 days if it doesn’t work in your area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MN6DSsu9Myyo6CdrSW5MJTjHoug=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-4-fd9968307cb44c9d9e824750413e0028.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105866/7443" target="_top" id="2105866">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105866" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105866/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884017/19272" target="_top" id="1884017">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884017" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884017/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna"><a href="#AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna"></a><strong>AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 (see<a class="link"   href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/ANTOP-Omni-Directional-Indoor-HD-UHF-VHF-TV-Antenna/1000503257" >online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a 40-mile range antenna that sells for around $35. It’s one of the better-looking antennas I’ve seen, as it’s reversible with faux light wood and dark wood sides. Unlike the AmazonBasics antenna, the Antop comes with a stand, and it has an easy-push connector for faster setup. These features go some ways towards justifying the Antop’s higher price tag.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A budget antenna that works as advertised.</strong></p><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna is a good option for anyone who wants an ultra-cheap way to get broadcast TV.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Ultra-Thin Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  AmazonBasics</li><li>SKU  DVB-T9088</li><li>Price  $20.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.09 x 13.31 x 0.075 in.</li><li>Warranty  30 day return policy, One year limited warranty</li><li>Resolution  1080p</li><li>Range  35 miles</li><li>Frequency  174-230 MHz</li><li>Receiving range  VHF&#x2F;UHF</li><li>Atenna version  Passive</li><li>Ports  Coax</li><li>Cable length  10-foot Coax Cable</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-expertly-crafted-video-making-software-iphone-android/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Expertly Crafted Video-Making Software (iPhone, Android)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/024-approved-zippy-typography-two-approaches-to-liven-up-your-letters/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Zippy Typography Two Approaches to Liven Up Your Letters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-omega-series-high-definition-full-touch-workstations/"><u>[New] Omega Series High Definition Full Touch Workstations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-edu-topic-10-selective-learning-channels-online/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Edu-Topic 10 Selective Learning Channels Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-nocturnal-notes-expert-advice-on-low-light-photos/"><u>2024 Approved Nocturnal Notes Expert Advice on Low Light Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/analyzing-the-implications-of-free-access-to-information-in-modern-digital-libraries-the-case-of-the-internet/"><u>Analyzing the Implications of Free Access to Information in Modern Digital Libraries: The Case of the Internet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/audio-transformation-for-tiktok-posts-explained-for-2024/"><u>Audio Transformation for TikTok Posts Explained for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/double-location-dongle-all-to-know-about-apple-iphone-xsipad-gps-spoofing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Double Location Dongle All to Know About Apple iPhone XS/iPad GPS Spoofing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-top.techidaily.com/dvdflac/"><u>DVDコレクションからファイルをFLACにアップグレード: ステップバイステップチュートリアル</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-does-pokegoplusplus-still-work-on-apple-iphone-11ipad-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 11/iPad? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-find-my-app-troubleshooting-no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-and-how-to-fix-them-on-apple-iphone-6-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Find My App Troubleshooting No Location Found vs. Location Not Available & How to Fix Them On Apple iPhone 6 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-hide-location-on-apple-iphone-xr-and-android-without-others-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Hide location on Apple iPhone XR and Android without others knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/quick-steps-to-change-weather-location-on-apple-iphone-15-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Quick Steps to Change Weather Location on Apple iPhone 15 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/quick-steps-to-change-weather-location-on-apple-iphone-6s-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Quick Steps to Change Weather Location on Apple iPhone 6s Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/the-best-android-unlock-software-for-samsung-galaxy-a05s-device-top-5-picks-to-remove-android-locks-by-drfone-android/"><u>The Best Android Unlock Software For Samsung Galaxy A05s Device Top 5 Picks to Remove Android Locks</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
