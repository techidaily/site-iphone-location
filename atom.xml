If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pokego"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pokego" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Pokego++?"></a>Part 1: What is Pokego++?</h2><p>If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature.

These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS.

Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon.

It stands for GPS Exchange format and stores map-related data in an XML format. Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.</p><p>From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>Coordinates</strong>: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.</li><li><strong>Routes</strong>: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).</li><li><strong>Tracks</strong>: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg"                      alt="GPX File"                ></p><p>Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?"></a>Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?</h2><p>The good thing is that there are tons of options to view GPX online on desktop, Android, or iOS platforms.

Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone XR or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.</p><p>When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone XR device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.</p><p>All we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to <strong>change location on Apple iPhone XR</strong>, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?"></a>Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?</h2><p>Step 1: On your Apple iPhone XR, go to the App Store app.</p><p>Step 2: Click on the “Featured” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/featured-tab-app-store.jpg"                      alt="featured tab app store"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, scroll down to locate your Apple id and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/locate-apple-id-app-store.jpg"                      alt="locate apple id app store"                ></p><p>Step 4: Choose “View Apple ID”.

It means that absolute online privacy as well as anonymity. VPN connects you to a server of your preference, which enables you to bypass all geo-restrictions for the desired content access. To simply put, a VPN helps you to unblock streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, etc outside your country and content access worldwide.</p><p>There are so many options available for VPN out there, so choosing the ideal one is a bit challenging. However, you can pick any popular options that support platform - Apple iPhone XR.  You can get ExpressVPN, IPVanish or NordVPN to fake the location on your Apple iPhone XR.</p><p>Here’s a quick guide on how to use VPN to fake or change location on the Apple iPhone XR:</p><p>(We have taken NordVPN as an example)</p><p>Step 1: Register with NordVPN by going to its official website.</p><p>Step 2: Get the NordVPN app on your Apple iPhone XR.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/NordVPN-download.jpg"                      alt="NordVPN download"                ></p><p>Step 3: Run the app and sign-in with your login details.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Quick Connect and give permissions the app asked to connect to the VPN.

For instance, swipe across the map until you see the UK. Then, you need to click on the server icon in the mid of that region to connect to the UK region.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/VPN.jpg"                      alt="VPN download"                ></p><p>That’s it.

How do I <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-location/how-to-change-weather-location-ipad.html" >change weather location on Apple iPhone XR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</strong></p><p>If you have changed your location or the app misperceives your location, follow these steps and get accurate weather updates:</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Go to your iDevice’s weather widget and long-press to choose the “Edit Weather” option. Now, tap “My Location” to check your current location. If it’s wrong and you want to change it, type and select the exact one in the “Search” bar. This way, your weather location will be changed on the weather app on your Apple iPhone XR.</p><p><strong>2. Will changing my location affect my device’s warranty or performance?</strong></p><p>The device’s warranty generally depends on the product and has nothing to do with moving locations. Yet it’s advisable to check the terms and conditions of the warranty. You can check if those conditions cover your device regardless of location. In short, changing location will not affect your phone, but you should note its local regulations.</p><p><strong>3. Is there a risk of my account being banned in certain apps or games if I change my location?</strong></p><p>Yes, you might encounter issues in certain apps if you change location on your Apple iPhone XR. This is because some apps have terms that prohibit falsifying locations. If they observe a rapid change in location due to VPN, it could lead to a ban to maintain fair play. To avoid this issue, always use a legitimate means of updating locations and be familiar with other terms.</p><p><strong>4. How do I change my location back to my real one?</strong></p><p>If you have faked your location on your Apple iPhone XR for certain games and applications, check the settings of your location spoofer. Within the app settings, you can revert to your actual location. Apart from that, if you are using a VPN to change location, disconnect from it. Upon turning it off, your device will return to the real location.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>In this guide, you have learned how to <strong>change location on the Apple iPhone XR</strong> in different scenarios.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-and-Offline-Solutions-Of-Apple-iPhone-14"><a href="#How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-and-Offline-Solutions-Of-Apple-iPhone-14" class="headerlink" title="How to View GPX Files: Online and Offline Solutions Of Apple iPhone 14"></a>How to View GPX Files: Online and Offline Solutions Of Apple iPhone 14</h2><p>Also known as GPS Exchange Format, GPX is one of the most resourceful file types that is used to store and import&#x2F;export map-related data. Ideally, a lot of people use GPX files to access a particular route offline when they are off the grid. Though, there are times when users find it hard to view GPX on a map. Don’t worry, there are plenty of ways to view GPX online or offline. In this post, I will let you know how to view GPX in Google Maps and other resourceful desktop applications in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files"><a href="#Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?"></a>Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?</h2><p>Before we discuss how to utilize a GPX view online or offline tool, let’s quickly consider how these files work. It stands for GPS Exchange format and stores map-related data in an XML format. Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.</p><p>From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>Coordinates</strong>: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.</li><li><strong>Routes</strong>: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).</li><li><strong>Tracks</strong>: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg"                      alt="GPX File"                ></p><p>Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?"></a>Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?</h2><p>The good thing is that there are tons of options to view GPX online on desktop, Android, or iOS platforms. Some of these freely available solutions to view GPX on Map are Google Earth, Google Maps, Bing Maps, Garmin BaseCamp, GPX Viewer, and so on.</p><p>Out of them, Google Maps is one of the most used solutions to view GPX online on smartphones and desktops alike. As of now, you can import GPX files in the KML format or even load CSV files of exact coordinates on Google Maps. To learn how to view GPX in Google Maps, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to Your Places in Google Maps</strong></p><p>To view GPX on the map, you can first head to the official website of Google Maps on your computer. Now, just click on the hamburger (three-line) icon from the top-left corner to access its options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-3.jpg"                      alt="Google Maps More Option"                ></p><p>This will display various options related to your Google Maps account. From here, you can just click on the “Your Places” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-4.jpg"                      alt="Google Maps Your Places"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose to Create a New Map</strong></p><p>As a dedicated section of “Your Places” would be launched, you can view all the saved places for your Google Maps account. Here, you can go to the “Maps” tab to view the existing saved route and spots. Since you have to view GPX in Google Maps, you can click on the “Create Map” option from the bottom to load a new map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-5.jpg"                      alt="Google Maps Create Map Option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Import and View the GPX File Online</strong></p><p>This will make Google Maps load a new page that will let you create a fresh map as per your preferences. Here, you can just click on the “Import” button to load a browser window from where you can directly load a GPX file on Google Maps and make it available offline as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-6.jpg"                      alt="Import GPX to Google Maps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-View-a-GPX-File-Offline-with-Dr-Fone-–-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-View-a-GPX-File-Offline-with-Dr-Fone-–-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to View a GPX File Offline with Dr.Fone – Virtual Location?"></a>Part 3: How to View a GPX File Offline with Dr.Fone – Virtual Location?</h2><p>Besides Google Maps, you can also take the assistance of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location to view GPX files on your computers offline. Since it is a desktop tool, it would let you load any GPX file without being connected to an active internet connection. Besides that, the application can also be used to spoof the location of your iOS device or simulate its movement in a route without jailbreaking it.</p><p>Therefore, if you want, you can first simulate the movement of your device and export the GPX file. Later, you can import the saved GPX file and simulate your Apple iPhone 14 movement in the same route without any trouble.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Launch Dr.Fone – Virtual Location and connect your Apple iPhone 14</strong></p><p>At first, you can just connect your Apple iPhone 14 using a working lightning cable and launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location application. Once your device is detected, just click on the “Get Started” and agree to its terms and conditions.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Simulate the Movement of your Apple iPhone 14</strong></p><p>The application would automatically detect your Apple iPhone 14 on the interface with its present location. To simulate its movement, you can click on the Multi-stop or One-stop Mode icons from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="one stop mode"                ></p><p>You can now drop the pin in a route on the map and click on the “Move Here” Button to start simulating the movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="simulate movement"                ></p><p>Subsequently, you can select the number of times you want to cover the route and click on the “March” button. The application will even let you select a preferred speed for the movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png"                      alt="select the speed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Export or Import the GPX Files</strong></p><p>Once you have loaded the map on the interface, you can easily save it offline as a GPX file. To do that, just click on the Export icon from the floating menu on the side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/save-one-stop-route.png"                      alt="save one stop route"                ></p><p>Similarly, you can also import a GPX file directly to the Dr.Fone application. To do this, you just have to click on the “Import” icon from the sidebar. This will open a browser window, letting you go to a location on your computer where the GPX file is saved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/import-gpx.png"                      alt="import gpx file"                ></p><p>Once the GPX file is loaded, you can simply wait for a while and let the application process it without closing it in between.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/wait-import-gpx.png"                      alt="wait import gpx"                ></p><p>As you can see, it is pretty easy to view GPX online or offline using the right tools. In this post, I have included a detailed guide on how to view GPX in Google Maps. Besides that, I have also included another solution to view GPX on a map using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (iOS). Apart from importing&#x2F;exporting GPX files, the application can also be used to spoof your Apple iPhone 14’s location or simulate its movement virtually from anywhere you want.</p><h2 id="How-to-Change-Your-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-14"><a href="#How-to-Change-Your-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-14" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Your Location on Apple iPhone 14"></a>How to Change Your Location on Apple iPhone 14</h2><p>There are several situations when you might have to change the location on your Apple iPhone 14. Perhaps you are moving to another region, so you have to make changes with your Apple ID to get App Store access. Or it could be the case that you want to change your region to access a certain application. Whatever your reason is to change your location on the Apple iPhone 14, you have come to the right place. In this post, we have discussed everything you should know about to <strong>spoof location on Apple iPhone 14</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Experience the freedom to teleport anywhere with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location!

Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone 14 or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.</p><p>When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 14 device.

It is now combined with Double Location and both together created three Double Location masterpieces. Apart from the obvious spoofing benefits, these have other benefits too –</p><h3 id="1-1-Double-Location-BT-2-0"><a href="#1-1-Double-Location-BT-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Double Location BT 2.0"></a>1.1 Double Location BT 2.0</h3><p>You don’t have to keep your Apple iPhone 8 Plus’s charging port occupied anymore.

Why choose Double Location Dongle?"></a>Part2. Why choose Double Location Dongle?</h2><p>Choosing Double Location Dongle will be a profit both because of its high functionality and long durability. Moreover, the hardware piece also provides additional benefits apart from the spoofing of location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 2"                ></p><h3 id="2-1-iOS-System-level-location-change"><a href="#2-1-iOS-System-level-location-change" class="headerlink" title="2.1 iOS System-level location change"></a>2.1 iOS System-level location change</h3><p>It provides iOS system level GPS manipulation that changes your location in all apps and even the ones with Apple protection cannot detect where you are actually seated.</p><h3 id="2-2-Safety-as-Priority"><a href="#2-2-Safety-as-Priority" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Safety as Priority"></a>2.2 Safety as Priority</h3><p>This dongle is completely safe and blocks any external interferences that try to capture your data illegally. It shields the bans from the Manufacturer’s (Apple) side. Your data and you are absolutely safe.</p><h3 id="2-3-No-Jailbreak"><a href="#2-3-No-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="2.3 No Jailbreak"></a>2.3 No Jailbreak</h3><p>Often, you might receive restrictions from the manufacturer during the GPS simulation. In that case, you have to consider jailbreak to get the job done. But Double Location doesn’t require jailbreak and smoothly gets your work done.</p><h3 id="2-4-No-need-of-PC"><a href="#2-4-No-need-of-PC" class="headerlink" title="2.4 No need of PC"></a>2.4 No need of PC</h3><p>You don’t need a computer for the Dongle to work.

Why should you not choose Double Location Dongle?"></a>Part3. Why should you not choose Double Location Dongle?</h2><p>While you’ve already seen one side of the coin, it is time to see the other one. Yes, there are good benefits to Double Location but I have to mention the cons as well in this double location dongle review.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 3"                ></p><h3 id="3-1-Costly-on-Comparison"><a href="#3-1-Costly-on-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Costly on Comparison"></a>3.1 Costly on Comparison</h3><p>Double Location dongle devices are costly. Because of their high efficiency, the sellers decided to tag them with high prices that might bring a frown on your face.</p><h3 id="3-2-Slow-Delivery"><a href="#3-2-Slow-Delivery" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Slow Delivery"></a>3.2 Slow Delivery</h3><p>The delivery time is excruciatingly long. It will take a lot of time for them to deliver your piece and if you are expecting it on a particular day, you will certainly be disappointed.</p><h3 id="3-3-Website-Design"><a href="#3-3-Website-Design" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Website Design"></a>3.3 Website Design</h3><p>The website layout is a bit confusing. After iTeleporter has combined with Double Location, they made a few modifications to the site. Now it is a tiny bit confusing to navigate through the pages and get to where you want. It could be a little simpler to make life easier.</p><h3 id="3-4-Helpline-Replies"><a href="#3-4-Helpline-Replies" class="headerlink" title="3.4 Helpline Replies"></a>3.4 Helpline Replies</h3><p>The helpline center’s response is so slow that I sometimes wonder if there is a helpline team. They have their pages on Facebook and Twitter. You can chat with executives on their official websites as well. Though they promise a response within 1 hour, it is not the case most of the time. They do reply but not when you most need it.</p><h2 id="Part4-How-to-use-Double-Location-Dongle-for-Apple-iPhone-8-Plus-iPad-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part4-How-to-use-Double-Location-Dongle-for-Apple-iPhone-8-Plus-iPad-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part4.

In particular, we will discuss how it works, its benefits, and how to use the software to spoof your Location. Importantly, we will discern the top 5 iTools Virtual Location alternatives.

User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location"></a>Part 3. User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location</h2><p>One of the best indicators of an online tool’s efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics. We did not thoroughly enjoy using the iTools Virtual Location ourselves. And that is because it does not include advanced features as the iTools Virtual Location alternatives mentioned here. Nevertheless, it is also good to look at other users’ feedback, so here are a few reviews from iTools users:</p><p><strong>Sri Viswakarma (Content Manager, Greenland LLC.)</strong></p><p><strong>Ratings: 4.8&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**I recently started using the iTools Virtual Location application, and I am impressed that it delivers on its promise. The price is quite high compared to other GPS location changes in the market, but during the Trial version of the tool, iTool’s simple interface stuck with me. It’s reliable, and I love how it lets me access location-restricted content. I recommend the iTools Virtual Location to anyone looking to change their GPS location on their Apple iPhone 14 Pro conveniently.”</p><p><strong>Kat Napiorkowska (Self-employed)</strong></p><p><strong>Rating: 2.3&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**After reading the good description of the iTools Virtual Location from the vendor, I was really excited to try the application. But I have to say that I am quite disappointed with iTools Virtual Location. I was really excited to try iTools Virtual Location, but I have to say I am quite disappointed with the app. In my opinion, the application’s user interface is quite confusing, and I found it difficult to navigate. I also experienced some bugs and crashes while using the app, which was frustrating. The location-changing feature didn’t seem to work well for me, as the new location wasn’t accurate or consistent. I was hoping for a reliable and efficient tool, but unfortunately, iTools Virtual Location did not meet my expectations. I would not recommend this app to others.”</p><h2 id="Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-iTools-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-iTools-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Likewise, your Apple iPhone 11 can take you home with just a few clicks on the address registered on the maps app. But what if your home address changes? How would you update your new address on your Apple iPhone 11? Read further to know the details about changing your home address on your Apple iPhone 11**!**</p><p>You can use dual maps apps on an iPhone, i.e., Google Maps and Apple Maps. Both the apps use the address registered on your contact card on your Apple iPhone 11. But the question arises of how to update the home address on iPhone. Although your phone can detect your location, it can’t set it as your home address on its own. In this article, we will discuss some of the most common ways of setting a home address on an iPhone. So, let’s get started!</p><p><strong>You can watch the video below to change your location on Google&#x2F;Apple Map</strong></p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uYgmr4GROsw"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Change-Your-Home-Address-in-Google-Maps-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Change-Your-Home-Address-in-Google-Maps-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Change Your Home Address in Google Maps on iPhone"></a>Part 1: How to Change Your Home Address in Google Maps on iPhone</h2><p>You can easily set your home address in Google maps on your Apple iPhone 11.

Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone 11 or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.</p><p>When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 11 device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.</p><p>All we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to <strong>change location on Apple iPhone 11</strong>, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?"></a>Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?</h2><p>Step 1: On your Apple iPhone 11, go to the App Store app.</p><p>Step 2: Click on the “Featured” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/featured-tab-app-store.jpg"                      alt="featured tab app store"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, scroll down to locate your Apple id and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/locate-apple-id-app-store.jpg"                      alt="locate apple id app store"                ></p><p>Step 4: Choose “View Apple ID”.

When you try to change the location, iTools Virtual Location does not respond.</li><li><strong>Not working on iOS 17-</strong> If there is an iOS version that hasn’t gone well with ITools is iOS 17. Although iTools has given a temporary solution for this, it still fails to work on some phones.</li><li><strong>Location won’t move-</strong> When using iTools Virtual Location, you always provide the desired GPS location data and click “Go.” After that, you are asked to click the “Move here” button to move to the chosen place. However, users have complained that at times the location fails to move from the previous to the currently selected location on apps like Facebook, and you end up finding yourself in a fake location.</li><li><strong>Image load failed-</strong> Image loading failure is a common problem amongst iOS 17 users.

Try it now and never lose your way!</em></p><h2 id="How-to-Solve-These-Issues"><a href="#How-to-Solve-These-Issues" class="headerlink" title="How to Solve These Issues?"></a>How to Solve These Issues?</h2><p>With the significant problems mentioned, it’s prudent for someone to ask now what the solution is.

Also, make sure your payments are settled and that the internet connection is established.</li><li><strong>Map crash-</strong> If the map crashes, it might be because of a problem with the google map API or unestablished communication with iTools. If Google Maps fails, click the three horizontal lines located at the right of the menu bar and switch to Mapbox. Also, check that your internet connection is working fine. If not, try to refresh your internet connection and ensure the connection is established.</li><li><strong>Stop working-</strong> When the iTools Virtual Location stops working, it might be due to unexpected technical issues.

The temporary solution offered for iOS 17 seems to work on some devices only.</li><li><strong>Location won’t move-</strong> when you change your current location and fail to move on your apps say google maps or Facebook, you will find yourself in fake location. Simply restart your device, and the problem will disappear.</li><li><strong>Image load failed-</strong> This issue is often related to compatibility issues. Check if you downloaded the program after the forced PoGo updates. You can try downgrading your device if you are doing iOS 17.</li></ul><h2 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-Safer-and-Stable-Tool-To-Change-Location-iOS-17-Supported"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-Safer-and-Stable-Tool-To-Change-Location-iOS-17-Supported" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location: Safer and Stable Tool To Change Location (iOS 17 Supported)"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location: Safer and Stable Tool To Change Location (iOS 17 Supported)</h2><p>As you have seen above, iTools Virtual Location software is faced with a pile of problems that make it difficult to safely and efficiently fake GPS locations.

It means that absolute online privacy as well as anonymity. VPN connects you to a server of your preference, which enables you to bypass all geo-restrictions for the desired content access. To simply put, a VPN helps you to unblock streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, etc outside your country and content access worldwide.</p><p>There are so many options available for VPN out there, so choosing the ideal one is a bit challenging. However, you can pick any popular options that support platform - Apple iPhone 15 Plus.  You can get ExpressVPN, IPVanish or NordVPN to fake the location on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.</p><p>Here’s a quick guide on how to use VPN to fake or change location on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus:</p><p>(We have taken NordVPN as an example)</p><p>Step 1: Register with NordVPN by going to its official website.</p><p>Step 2: Get the NordVPN app on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/NordVPN-download.jpg"                      alt="NordVPN download"                ></p><p>Step 3: Run the app and sign-in with your login details.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Quick Connect and give permissions the app asked to connect to the VPN. In a while, you’ll view a map that shows various servers worldwide.</p><p>Step 5: To change location, select the ‘Map &#x2F;List” view - you can click on the country or region you want to set. For instance, swipe across the map until you see the UK. Then, you need to click on the server icon in the mid of that region to connect to the UK region.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/VPN.jpg"                      alt="VPN download"                ></p><p>That’s it.

How do I <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-location/how-to-change-weather-location-ipad.html" >change weather location on Apple iPhone 15 Plus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</strong></p><p>If you have changed your location or the app misperceives your location, follow these steps and get accurate weather updates:</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Go to your iDevice’s weather widget and long-press to choose the “Edit Weather” option. Now, tap “My Location” to check your current location. If it’s wrong and you want to change it, type and select the exact one in the “Search” bar. This way, your weather location will be changed on the weather app on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.</p><p><strong>2. Will changing my location affect my device’s warranty or performance?</strong></p><p>The device’s warranty generally depends on the product and has nothing to do with moving locations. Yet it’s advisable to check the terms and conditions of the warranty. You can check if those conditions cover your device regardless of location. In short, changing location will not affect your phone, but you should note its local regulations.</p><p><strong>3. Is there a risk of my account being banned in certain apps or games if I change my location?</strong></p><p>Yes, you might encounter issues in certain apps if you change location on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus. This is because some apps have terms that prohibit falsifying locations. If they observe a rapid change in location due to VPN, it could lead to a ban to maintain fair play. To avoid this issue, always use a legitimate means of updating locations and be familiar with other terms.</p><p><strong>4. How do I change my location back to my real one?</strong></p><p>If you have faked your location on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus for certain games and applications, check the settings of your location spoofer. Within the app settings, you can revert to your actual location. Apart from that, if you are using a VPN to change location, disconnect from it. Upon turning it off, your device will return to the real location.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>In this guide, you have learned how to <strong>change location on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus</strong> in different scenarios.

User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location"></a>Part 3. User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location</h2><p>One of the best indicators of an online tool’s efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics. We did not thoroughly enjoy using the iTools Virtual Location ourselves. And that is because it does not include advanced features as the iTools Virtual Location alternatives mentioned here. Nevertheless, it is also good to look at other users’ feedback, so here are a few reviews from iTools users:</p><p><strong>Sri Viswakarma (Content Manager, Greenland LLC.)</strong></p><p><strong>Ratings: 4.8&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**I recently started using the iTools Virtual Location application, and I am impressed that it delivers on its promise. The price is quite high compared to other GPS location changes in the market, but during the Trial version of the tool, iTool’s simple interface stuck with me. It’s reliable, and I love how it lets me access location-restricted content. I recommend the iTools Virtual Location to anyone looking to change their GPS location on their Apple iPhone 15 Pro conveniently.”</p><p><strong>Kat Napiorkowska (Self-employed)</strong></p><p><strong>Rating: 2.3&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**After reading the good description of the iTools Virtual Location from the vendor, I was really excited to try the application. But I have to say that I am quite disappointed with iTools Virtual Location. I was really excited to try iTools Virtual Location, but I have to say I am quite disappointed with the app. In my opinion, the application’s user interface is quite confusing, and I found it difficult to navigate. I also experienced some bugs and crashes while using the app, which was frustrating. The location-changing feature didn’t seem to work well for me, as the new location wasn’t accurate or consistent. I was hoping for a reliable and efficient tool, but unfortunately, iTools Virtual Location did not meet my expectations. I would not recommend this app to others.”</p><h2 id="Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-iTools-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-iTools-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.</p><p>One such cheat&#x2F;hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pokego"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pokego" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Pokego++?"></a>Part 1: What is Pokego++?</h2><p>If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 11&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 11 or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon. So, if PokeGo++ doesn’t work anymore, what’s an alternative that can help you use a fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.</p><p>The answer is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.
