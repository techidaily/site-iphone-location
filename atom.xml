You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 6&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS.

Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 6 or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon.

Of course, these issues are triggered differently, but there are respective common fixes. However, some can successfully fix the problem while other solutions may hit the blank. Let’s see some of the probable solutions to the issues mentioned above.</p><ul><li><strong>Developer mode-</strong> The solution is to check for the iTools updates for your device.</li><li><strong>Not downloading-</strong> if the program fails to download, check that your device meets the system requirements. Also, make sure your payments are settled and that the internet connection is established.</li><li><strong>Map crash-</strong> If the map crashes, it might be because of a problem with the google map API or unestablished communication with iTools. If Google Maps fails, click the three horizontal lines located at the right of the menu bar and switch to Mapbox. Also, check that your internet connection is working fine. If not, try to refresh your internet connection and ensure the connection is established.</li><li><strong>Stop working-</strong> When the iTools Virtual Location stops working, it might be due to unexpected technical issues. Try restarting the program, and if it persists, restart your device.</li><li><strong>Not working on iOS 17-</strong> As aforementioned, iOS 17 has had issues with iTools. One of the best ways to ensure a smooth click with iTools is to downgrade your iOS 17 to say iOS 16. The temporary solution offered for iOS 17 seems to work on some devices only.</li><li><strong>Location won’t move-</strong> when you change your current location and fail to move on your apps say google maps or Facebook, you will find yourself in fake location. Simply restart your device, and the problem will disappear.</li><li><strong>Image load failed-</strong> This issue is often related to compatibility issues. Check if you downloaded the program after the forced PoGo updates. You can try downgrading your device if you are doing iOS 17.</li></ul><h2 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-Safer-and-Stable-Tool-To-Change-Location-iOS-17-Supported"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-Safer-and-Stable-Tool-To-Change-Location-iOS-17-Supported" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location: Safer and Stable Tool To Change Location (iOS 17 Supported)"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location: Safer and Stable Tool To Change Location (iOS 17 Supported)</h2><p>As you have seen above, iTools Virtual Location software is faced with a pile of problems that make it difficult to safely and efficiently fake GPS locations.

Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPad, or other Apple devices.

Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://martinic.evyy.net/c/5597632/1422856/4482" target="_top" id="1422856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4482-1422856"                      border="0" alt="" width="580" height="309"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them. While both errors involve the inaccessibility of the location services, some causes also display similarities among them.

These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 15 Plus&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS.

Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 15 Plus or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon.

This way, your weather location will be changed on the weather app on your Apple iPhone 14.</p><p><strong>2. Will changing my location affect my device’s warranty or performance?</strong></p><p>The device’s warranty generally depends on the product and has nothing to do with moving locations. Yet it’s advisable to check the terms and conditions of the warranty. You can check if those conditions cover your device regardless of location. In short, changing location will not affect your phone, but you should note its local regulations.</p><p><strong>3. Is there a risk of my account being banned in certain apps or games if I change my location?</strong></p><p>Yes, you might encounter issues in certain apps if you change location on your Apple iPhone 14. This is because some apps have terms that prohibit falsifying locations. If they observe a rapid change in location due to VPN, it could lead to a ban to maintain fair play. To avoid this issue, always use a legitimate means of updating locations and be familiar with other terms.</p><p><strong>4. How do I change my location back to my real one?</strong></p><p>If you have faked your location on your Apple iPhone 14 for certain games and applications, check the settings of your location spoofer. Within the app settings, you can revert to your actual location. Apart from that, if you are using a VPN to change location, disconnect from it. Upon turning it off, your device will return to the real location.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://cowinaudio.pxf.io/c/5597632/1116855/13794" target="_top" id="1116855"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13794-1116855"                      border="0" alt="" width="767" height="285"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1116855/13794"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>In this guide, you have learned how to <strong>change location on the Apple iPhone 14</strong> in different scenarios.

For instance, if you use Safari, then you might be familiar with the autofill feature. While filling a form in Safari, it would automatically detect the fields and will enter the relevant information on its own.

In this way, the application can enter your changed address while autofilling a form. Here’s a simple tweak that you can do to change home address in Apple iPhone 13 Pro autofill.</p><p>Step 1. Firstly, you need to follow the above-mentioned drill and go to your own contact card to change your home address.</p><p>Step 2. Once you have changed your home address in contacts, just go to your Apple iPhone 13 Pro’s Settings &gt; Safari and tap on the “Autofill” option under the General section.</p><p>Step 3.

Now, tap on the “My Info” option to view your details like name, email, address, and so on.

User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location</h2><p>One of the best indicators of an online tool’s efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics. We did not thoroughly enjoy using the iTools Virtual Location ourselves. And that is because it does not include advanced features as the iTools Virtual Location alternatives mentioned here. Nevertheless, it is also good to look at other users’ feedback, so here are a few reviews from iTools users:</p><p><strong>Sri Viswakarma (Content Manager, Greenland LLC.)</strong></p><p><strong>Ratings: 4.8&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**I recently started using the iTools Virtual Location application, and I am impressed that it delivers on its promise. The price is quite high compared to other GPS location changes in the market, but during the Trial version of the tool, iTool’s simple interface stuck with me. It’s reliable, and I love how it lets me access location-restricted content. I recommend the iTools Virtual Location to anyone looking to change their GPS location on their Apple iPhone 13 Pro conveniently.”</p><p><strong>Kat Napiorkowska (Self-employed)</strong></p><p><strong>Rating: 2.3&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**After reading the good description of the iTools Virtual Location from the vendor, I was really excited to try the application. But I have to say that I am quite disappointed with iTools Virtual Location. I was really excited to try iTools Virtual Location, but I have to say I am quite disappointed with the app. In my opinion, the application’s user interface is quite confusing, and I found it difficult to navigate. I also experienced some bugs and crashes while using the app, which was frustrating. The location-changing feature didn’t seem to work well for me, as the new location wasn’t accurate or consistent. I was hoping for a reliable and efficient tool, but unfortunately, iTools Virtual Location did not meet my expectations. I would not recommend this app to others.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4727541&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/copy_copy_forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Gold Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-iTools-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-iTools-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Lexa’s Fake GPS Location"></a>4. Lexa’s Fake GPS Location</h3><p>Lexa’s Fake GPS Location is pretty much similar to the aforementioned Fake GPS Location Spoofer. It is free, simple to use, and effective on only some location-based applications. Still, useful features like the History allow you to find the previously used routes. Additionally, you can get information about the altitude and the place when you mark it on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/mock-location-lexa-fake-gps.jpg"                      alt="lexa fake gps location spoofer"                ></p><p>The best thing about Lexa Fake GPS Location is its simplicity. The sheer straightforwardness of the user interface makes it suitable for non-tech-savvy users looking for a simple means to alter their location. Unlike iTools 4 Virtual Location, you do not need a computer to get the job done.</p><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li>You can set intervals and multiple stops within a route.</li><li>A range of settings allows you to customize the tool as per need.</li><li>Import GPX files and travel on readymade routes.</li><li>You can access the Historical records and move along the past routes conveniently.</li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Entirely free to use; there is no need to sign up.</li><li>You can enter coordinates instead of names to move to a definite location.</li><li>Use joysticks or a keyboard to simulate the fake GPS movement.</li><li>You can use it to access restricted content.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Fake GPS Location Spoofer does not work on all location-based applications.</li><li>Tons of ads annoy you during the setup process.</li><li>There is no option to remove the icon from the notification bar.</li></ul><h3 id="5-Fake-GPS-Run"><a href="#5-Fake-GPS-Run" class="headerlink" title="5. Fake GPS Run"></a>5. Fake GPS Run</h3><p>Fake GPS Run is another suitable iTools Virtual Location alternative that gets the job done for the most part and does not charge you even a dime. You can move to a different location using GPS coordinates or simply searching for the place. You can also set up routes or import readymade routes via GPX files. You can also access the previous routes saved in the Historical records to quickly move to a past route.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/fake-gps-run.jpg"                      alt="fake gps run"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe id="iframe_672" src="//a.impactradius-go.com/gen-ad-code/5597632/1959812/17834/" width="720" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end -->The best thing about Fake GPS Run is its simple-to-use interface. In fact, when you compare the last two iTools alternative to Fake GPS Run, you will find that all three are basically the same applications under different uniforms. But when it comes to uniform the interface, Fake GPS Run wins the contest. Like its earlier two predecessors, it is free but burdens the users with tons of ads.<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Fake GPS Run is made explicitly for Samsung users.</li><li>You can enter the location coordinates and locate them accurately.</li><li>You can hide the Fake GPS Run icon from the notification bar.</li><li>It works well on most location-based apps and websites.</li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Completely free to use.</li><li>You can access the Historical records and move along the past route.</li><li>You can set stop points in the chosen route.</li><li>Elegant interface.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Bugs and issues.</li><li>It does not work well with advanced applications like Pokemon Go.</li><li>Android 6.0 and above.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-6-FAQs-About-iTools-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-6-FAQs-About-iTools-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 6.

Is iTools Virtual Location Safe?"></a>2. Is iTools Virtual Location Safe?</h3><p>Yes. iTools Virtual Location is entirely safe to use. However, you must remember that it is not the nature of the iTools Virtual Location that will cause problems. For instance, iTools comes from ThinkSkySoft, which is a reputed brand. Nevertheless, it does not use advanced algorithms to spoof GPS location. As a result, many social applications identify the application and may ban you.</p><h3 id="3-Can-you-change-your-Android-location-with-iTools"><a href="#3-Can-you-change-your-Android-location-with-iTools" class="headerlink" title="3. Can you change your Android location with iTools?"></a>3. Can you change your Android location with iTools?</h3><p>No. The older versions of Android (Android 5.0 and earlier) allow you to change the GPS location without root. However, the newer versions (Android 6.0 and later) do not allow you to change the location without rooting. iTools Virtual Location cannot help you in this regard.</p><p>However, some applications like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allow you to change the location on Android 6.0 and later versions conveniently.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>iTools Virtual Location, all in all, is a comprehensive program and is equipped with all the necessary tools that one might look for in a GPS spoofing application. It allows you to move automatically, manually, and at different speeds. You can also mark the Pins in a route and make the simulation look genuine. However, the problem forces you to purchase the full Toolset to use the application. You have to pay US$ 59.95 to use one function of the tool. Aside from that, it does not use advanced algorithms, so some apps might crash or not work with iTools Virtual Location.</p><p>And that’s why we include the five best iTools Virtual Location alternatives. You can choose any of the five as they have nearly the features that iTools Virtual Location does. The first one in the alternative list, the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , is the most significant location changer in the market. It costs nearly 5x lower than iTools Virtual Location and offers more features. Plus, it is more sophisticated and simple to use compared to iTools.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-convert-jpg-and-png-images-to-pdf-on-an-iphone/"><u>[Updated] How to Convert JPG and PNG Images to PDF on an iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-efficiency-at-play-reducing-youtube-video-length/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Efficiency at Play  Reducing YouTube Video Length</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-unlocking-asmr-potential-professional-filming-practices-revealed/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking ASMR Potential  Professional Filming Practices Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-moviemaker-masterwin8/"><u>2024 Approved  MovieMaker MasterWin8</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/4-effective-methods-fake-gps-location-on-apple-iphone-12ipad-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>4 Effective Methods Fake GPS Location on Apple iPhone 12/iPad | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/7-fixes-to-no-gps-showing-approximate-location-on-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-waze-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>7 Fixes to No GPS - Showing Approximate Location on Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max Waze | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/a-full-review-for-itools-virtual-location-and-top-5-alternatives-for-apple-iphone-14-pro-maxipad-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>A Full Review for iTools Virtual Location and Top 5 Alternatives For Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max/iPad | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/constellation-cache-universe-backup-service/"><u>Constellation Cache - Universe Backup Service</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/does-itools-virtual-location-not-work-on-apple-iphone-13-proipad-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Does iTools virtual location not work On Apple iPhone 13 Pro/iPad?

Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 12 Pro Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 12 Pro Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 12 Pro.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 12 Pro has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ancheer.sjv.io/c/5597632/1657301/17326" target="_top" id="1657301"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1657301"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="933"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657301/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 12 Pro, iPad, or other Apple devices.

Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 12 Pro, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 12 Pro Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 12 Pro Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 12 Pro may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 12 Pro’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 12 Pro] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 12 Pro needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 12 Pro run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 12 Pro provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 12 Pro are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 12 Pro in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 12 Pro is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 12 Pro. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.advancedwebranking.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715051&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/14edc6ebfdae2e23bbed83d67f50e983/products/33_awr%20logo.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone 12 mini or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.</p><p>When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 12 mini device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.</p><p>All we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to <strong>change location on Apple iPhone 12 mini</strong>, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082538/7443" target="_top" id="2082538"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082538"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?"></a>Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?</h2><p>Step 1: On your Apple iPhone 12 mini, go to the App Store app.</p><p>Step 2: Click on the “Featured” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/featured-tab-app-store.jpg"                      alt="featured tab app store"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1678785/12108" target="_top" id="1678785"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1678785"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 3: Now, scroll down to locate your Apple id and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/locate-apple-id-app-store.jpg"                      alt="locate apple id app store"                ></p><p>Step 4: Choose “View Apple ID”.

How do I <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-location/how-to-change-weather-location-ipad.html" >change weather location on Apple iPhone 12 mini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</strong></p><p>If you have changed your location or the app misperceives your location, follow these steps and get accurate weather updates:</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Go to your iDevice’s weather widget and long-press to choose the “Edit Weather” option. Now, tap “My Location” to check your current location. If it’s wrong and you want to change it, type and select the exact one in the “Search” bar. This way, your weather location will be changed on the weather app on your Apple iPhone 12 mini.</p><p><strong>2. Will changing my location affect my device’s warranty or performance?</strong></p><p>The device’s warranty generally depends on the product and has nothing to do with moving locations. Yet it’s advisable to check the terms and conditions of the warranty. You can check if those conditions cover your device regardless of location. In short, changing location will not affect your phone, but you should note its local regulations.</p><p><strong>3. Is there a risk of my account being banned in certain apps or games if I change my location?</strong></p><p>Yes, you might encounter issues in certain apps if you change location on your Apple iPhone 12 mini. This is because some apps have terms that prohibit falsifying locations. If they observe a rapid change in location due to VPN, it could lead to a ban to maintain fair play. To avoid this issue, always use a legitimate means of updating locations and be familiar with other terms.</p><p><strong>4. How do I change my location back to my real one?</strong></p><p>If you have faked your location on your Apple iPhone 12 mini for certain games and applications, check the settings of your location spoofer. Within the app settings, you can revert to your actual location. Apart from that, if you are using a VPN to change location, disconnect from it. Upon turning it off, your device will return to the real location.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17729331&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner600x500.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>In this guide, you have learned how to <strong>change location on the Apple iPhone 12 mini</strong> in different scenarios.

Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 12 device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 12 device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-12-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-12-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 12 Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 12 Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 12 device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 12 device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 12 device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 12 device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 12 device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 12.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 12 are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 12 has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 12 device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 12 device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 12 device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 12 device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 12 device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 12, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 12, iPad, or other Apple devices.

However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=32667153&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.coolmuster.com/uploads/image/20201228/feature02.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-12-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-12-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 12 Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 12 Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 12 may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 12’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 12] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 12 needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 12 run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 12 device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 12 provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 12 are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 12 device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 12 device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 12 in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 12 relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 12 is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 12. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 12’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

Don’t worry, there are plenty of ways to view GPX online or offline. In this post, I will let you know how to view GPX in Google Maps and other resourceful desktop applications in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files"><a href="#Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?"></a>Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?</h2><p>Before we discuss how to utilize a GPX view online or offline tool, let’s quickly consider how these files work. It stands for GPS Exchange format and stores map-related data in an XML format. Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.</p><p>From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>Coordinates</strong>: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.</li><li><strong>Routes</strong>: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).</li><li><strong>Tracks</strong>: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg"                      alt="GPX File"                ></p><p>Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?"></a>Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?</h2><p>The good thing is that there are tons of options to view GPX online on desktop, Android, or iOS platforms.

Meanwhile, its GPS function allows users to stay active on the real-time map technology. However, GPS not working on Apple iPhone 11 Pros is a common problem. When this happens, you cannot track pinpoint locations.</p><p>This means you will find difficulty in locating your destination. Moreover, you will not be able to use those applications that rely on GPS technology. For example, a fitness app needs to track your distance and route.

In fact, you can also track any human depending on their live location. But as an iOS user, it’s normal to face <strong><strong>Apple iPhone 11 Pro GPS not working</strong></strong>. Why does this happen? Here are the following reasons behind this error:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Glitches and Bugs:</strong></strong> A most common reason for GPS not working is due to glitches and bugs. Hence, this may happen because of underlying iOS or GPS app issues. Either there was a bug in the version update, or the app is facing malfunctions.</li><li><strong><strong>Airplane Mode:</strong></strong> When airplane mode is enabled on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, this may cause a GPS issue. You may have forgotten to turn off your airplane mode after air travel. Not to forget, turning off GPS is necessary during flight as per regulations.</li><li><strong><strong>Incorrect Settings:</strong></strong> It’s possible that GPS settings are not properly configured on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro. Like, you may have accidentally turned off location services. While using your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, turning on and off certain features is common.</li><li><strong><strong>Hardware Issue:</strong></strong> If your phone is exposed to water or physical damage, this may affect GPS. There may be a hardware issue caused due to this situation.

If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.</p><p>When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 11 device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.</p><p>All we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to <strong>change location on Apple iPhone 11</strong>, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4572700&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.tubedigger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tubedigger-software-new.png"                      border="0"                >TubeDigger - online video downloader from mostly any site</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?"></a>Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?</h2><p>Step 1: On your Apple iPhone 11, go to the App Store app.</p><p>Step 2: Click on the “Featured” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/featured-tab-app-store.jpg"                      alt="featured tab app store"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713324&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVTV1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV TV Webcaster</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 3: Now, scroll down to locate your Apple id and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/locate-apple-id-app-store.jpg"                      alt="locate apple id app store"                ></p><p>Step 4: Choose “View Apple ID”.

Now, tap “My Location” to check your current location. If it’s wrong and you want to change it, type and select the exact one in the “Search” bar. This way, your weather location will be changed on the weather app on your Apple iPhone 11.</p><p><strong>2. Will changing my location affect my device’s warranty or performance?</strong></p><p>The device’s warranty generally depends on the product and has nothing to do with moving locations. Yet it’s advisable to check the terms and conditions of the warranty. You can check if those conditions cover your device regardless of location. In short, changing location will not affect your phone, but you should note its local regulations.</p><p><strong>3. Is there a risk of my account being banned in certain apps or games if I change my location?</strong></p><p>Yes, you might encounter issues in certain apps if you change location on your Apple iPhone 11. This is because some apps have terms that prohibit falsifying locations. If they observe a rapid change in location due to VPN, it could lead to a ban to maintain fair play. To avoid this issue, always use a legitimate means of updating locations and be familiar with other terms.</p><p><strong>4. How do I change my location back to my real one?</strong></p><p>If you have faked your location on your Apple iPhone 11 for certain games and applications, check the settings of your location spoofer. Within the app settings, you can revert to your actual location. Apart from that, if you are using a VPN to change location, disconnect from it. Upon turning it off, your device will return to the real location.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>In this guide, you have learned how to <strong>change location on the Apple iPhone 11</strong> in different scenarios.
