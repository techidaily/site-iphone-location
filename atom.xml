Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well.

Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPad, or other Apple devices.

This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

In particular, we will discuss how it works, its benefits, and how to use the software to spoof your Location. Importantly, we will discern the top 5 iTools Virtual Location alternatives. In case you do not like what iTools offers, you can pick one of the iTools alternatives and spoof your location in the same manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/itool-virtual-location.jpg"                      alt="itool virtual location logo"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Overview-of-iTools-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-1-Overview-of-iTools-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

One of the most exciting tools is the iTools Virtual Location which allows users to change their location to any other location in the world and trick location-based apps on their devices.</p><p>This feature is specifically useful to access location-restricted content or websites and privacy. You can also play games like Pokemon Go from the comfort of your home and still have all the best Pokemon in your collection.</p><p>The Virtual Location feature of iTools works by spoofing the GPS data of your Apple devices.

Similarly, if the Apple iPhone XS Max device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone XS Max device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone XS Max Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone XS Max Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone XS Max device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone XS Max device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone XS Max device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone XS Max device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone XS Max device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone XS Max.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone XS Max are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone XS Max has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone XS Max device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone XS Max device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone XS Max device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone XS Max device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone XS Max device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone XS Max, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone XS Max, iPad, or other Apple devices.

Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone XS Max] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone XS Max needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone XS Max run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched.

Apple iPhone XS Max provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone XS Max are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone XS Max device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone XS Max device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone XS Max in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity.

Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone XS Max is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone XS Max. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone XS Max’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location"></a>Part 3. User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location</h2><p>One of the best indicators of an online tool’s efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics. We did not thoroughly enjoy using the iTools Virtual Location ourselves. And that is because it does not include advanced features as the iTools Virtual Location alternatives mentioned here. Nevertheless, it is also good to look at other users’ feedback, so here are a few reviews from iTools users:</p><p><strong>Sri Viswakarma (Content Manager, Greenland LLC.)</strong></p><p><strong>Ratings: 4.8&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**I recently started using the iTools Virtual Location application, and I am impressed that it delivers on its promise. The price is quite high compared to other GPS location changes in the market, but during the Trial version of the tool, iTool’s simple interface stuck with me.

I recommend the iTools Virtual Location to anyone looking to change their GPS location on their Apple iPhone XR conveniently.”</p><p><strong>Kat Napiorkowska (Self-employed)</strong></p><p><strong>Rating: 2.3&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**After reading the good description of the iTools Virtual Location from the vendor, I was really excited to try the application. But I have to say that I am quite disappointed with iTools Virtual Location. I was really excited to try iTools Virtual Location, but I have to say I am quite disappointed with the app. In my opinion, the application’s user interface is quite confusing, and I found it difficult to navigate.

I was hoping for a reliable and efficient tool, but unfortunately, iTools Virtual Location did not meet my expectations. I would not recommend this app to others.”</p><h2 id="Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-iTools-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-iTools-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location"></a>Part 3. User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location</h2><p>One of the best indicators of an online tool’s efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics. We did not thoroughly enjoy using the iTools Virtual Location ourselves. And that is because it does not include advanced features as the iTools Virtual Location alternatives mentioned here. Nevertheless, it is also good to look at other users’ feedback, so here are a few reviews from iTools users:</p><p><strong>Sri Viswakarma (Content Manager, Greenland LLC.)</strong></p><p><strong>Ratings: 4.8&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**I recently started using the iTools Virtual Location application, and I am impressed that it delivers on its promise. The price is quite high compared to other GPS location changes in the market, but during the Trial version of the tool, iTool’s simple interface stuck with me. It’s reliable, and I love how it lets me access location-restricted content. I recommend the iTools Virtual Location to anyone looking to change their GPS location on their Apple iPhone X conveniently.”</p><p><strong>Kat Napiorkowska (Self-employed)</strong></p><p><strong>Rating: 2.3&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**After reading the good description of the iTools Virtual Location from the vendor, I was really excited to try the application. But I have to say that I am quite disappointed with iTools Virtual Location. I was really excited to try iTools Virtual Location, but I have to say I am quite disappointed with the app. In my opinion, the application’s user interface is quite confusing, and I found it difficult to navigate.

In particular, we will discuss how it works, its benefits, and how to use the software to spoof your Location. Importantly, we will discern the top 5 iTools Virtual Location alternatives.

User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location"></a>Part 3. User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location</h2><p>One of the best indicators of an online tool’s efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics. We did not thoroughly enjoy using the iTools Virtual Location ourselves. And that is because it does not include advanced features as the iTools Virtual Location alternatives mentioned here. Nevertheless, it is also good to look at other users’ feedback, so here are a few reviews from iTools users:</p><p><strong>Sri Viswakarma (Content Manager, Greenland LLC.)</strong></p><p><strong>Ratings: 4.8&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**I recently started using the iTools Virtual Location application, and I am impressed that it delivers on its promise. The price is quite high compared to other GPS location changes in the market, but during the Trial version of the tool, iTool’s simple interface stuck with me. It’s reliable, and I love how it lets me access location-restricted content. I recommend the iTools Virtual Location to anyone looking to change their GPS location on their Apple iPhone SE conveniently.”</p><p><strong>Kat Napiorkowska (Self-employed)</strong></p><p><strong>Rating: 2.3&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**After reading the good description of the iTools Virtual Location from the vendor, I was really excited to try the application. But I have to say that I am quite disappointed with iTools Virtual Location. I was really excited to try iTools Virtual Location, but I have to say I am quite disappointed with the app. In my opinion, the application’s user interface is quite confusing, and I found it difficult to navigate. I also experienced some bugs and crashes while using the app, which was frustrating. The location-changing feature didn’t seem to work well for me, as the new location wasn’t accurate or consistent. I was hoping for a reliable and efficient tool, but unfortunately, iTools Virtual Location did not meet my expectations. I would not recommend this app to others.”</p><h2 id="Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-iTools-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-iTools-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Double Location Dongle is one such miraculous creation that is capable of locking your location in a place you’ve never been to before. Now combined with iTeleporter, it works well for a wide range of locations, dating and gaming apps. Let’s go on and see the Double Location Dongle review.</p><h2 id="Part1-About-Double-Location-Dongle"><a href="#Part1-About-Double-Location-Dongle" class="headerlink" title="Part1.

These are very useful hardware pieces that look small but hold huge value. These are inserted into your laptop or phone’s charging port and then help you to fake your location. Double location Dongle does this job perfectly. It is conveniently compatible with the Apple devices from iOS9 to the latest iOS 13.</p><p>iTeleporter Pro 2.0 is a similar dongle that was very efficient in spoofing an individual’s location. It is now combined with Double Location and both together created three Double Location masterpieces. Apart from the obvious spoofing benefits, these have other benefits too –</p><h3 id="1-1-Double-Location-BT-2-0"><a href="#1-1-Double-Location-BT-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Double Location BT 2.0"></a>1.1 Double Location BT 2.0</h3><p>You don’t have to keep your Apple iPhone SE’s charging port occupied anymore.

Why choose Double Location Dongle?"></a>Part2. Why choose Double Location Dongle?</h2><p>Choosing Double Location Dongle will be a profit both because of its high functionality and long durability. Moreover, the hardware piece also provides additional benefits apart from the spoofing of location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 2"                ></p><h3 id="2-1-iOS-System-level-location-change"><a href="#2-1-iOS-System-level-location-change" class="headerlink" title="2.1 iOS System-level location change"></a>2.1 iOS System-level location change</h3><p>It provides iOS system level GPS manipulation that changes your location in all apps and even the ones with Apple protection cannot detect where you are actually seated.</p><h3 id="2-2-Safety-as-Priority"><a href="#2-2-Safety-as-Priority" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Safety as Priority"></a>2.2 Safety as Priority</h3><p>This dongle is completely safe and blocks any external interferences that try to capture your data illegally.

Your data and you are absolutely safe.</p><h3 id="2-3-No-Jailbreak"><a href="#2-3-No-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="2.3 No Jailbreak"></a>2.3 No Jailbreak</h3><p>Often, you might receive restrictions from the manufacturer during the GPS simulation.

But Double Location doesn’t require jailbreak and smoothly gets your work done.</p><h3 id="2-4-No-need-of-PC"><a href="#2-4-No-need-of-PC" class="headerlink" title="2.4 No need of PC"></a>2.4 No need of PC</h3><p>You don’t need a computer for the Dongle to work.

Yes, there are good benefits to Double Location but I have to mention the cons as well in this double location dongle review.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/double-location-dongle-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle pic 3"                ></p><h3 id="3-1-Costly-on-Comparison"><a href="#3-1-Costly-on-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Costly on Comparison"></a>3.1 Costly on Comparison</h3><p>Double Location dongle devices are costly.

After iTeleporter has combined with Double Location, they made a few modifications to the site. Now it is a tiny bit confusing to navigate through the pages and get to where you want. It could be a little simpler to make life easier.</p><h3 id="3-4-Helpline-Replies"><a href="#3-4-Helpline-Replies" class="headerlink" title="3.4 Helpline Replies"></a>3.4 Helpline Replies</h3><p>The helpline center’s response is so slow that I sometimes wonder if there is a helpline team. They have their pages on Facebook and Twitter. You can chat with executives on their official websites as well. Though they promise a response within 1 hour, it is not the case most of the time. They do reply but not when you most need it.</p><h2 id="Part4-How-to-use-Double-Location-Dongle-for-Apple-iPhone-SE-iPad-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part4-How-to-use-Double-Location-Dongle-for-Apple-iPhone-SE-iPad-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part4.

In particular, we will discuss how it works, its benefits, and how to use the software to spoof your Location. Importantly, we will discern the top 5 iTools Virtual Location alternatives. In case you do not like what iTools offers, you can pick one of the iTools alternatives and spoof your location in the same manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/itool-virtual-location.jpg"                      alt="itool virtual location logo"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Overview-of-iTools-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-1-Overview-of-iTools-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

One of the most exciting tools is the iTools Virtual Location which allows users to change their location to any other location in the world and trick location-based apps on their devices.</p><p>This feature is specifically useful to access location-restricted content or websites and privacy. You can also play games like Pokemon Go from the comfort of your home and still have all the best Pokemon in your collection.</p><p>The Virtual Location feature of iTools works by spoofing the GPS data of your Apple devices. To get into technicalities, when you select a different location, your device will send false GPS coordinates to other applications and services. This will trick the application into thinking you are in a different location.</p><p>All in all, iTools Virtual Location presents a simple range of features and a very straightforward interface. This means even the least tech-literates can use iTools Virtual Location conveniently, access restricted content, and play location-based games like Pokemon Go seamlessly.</p><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li>You can change the location on your Apple iPhone SE (2022) or iPad without rooting or jailbreaking the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device.</li><li>You can change the GPS location on your Apple iPhone SE (2022) and iPad within a few clicks.</li><li>Play location-based games like Pokemon Go and AR games from the comfort of your home.</li><li>Simulate the GPS movements using keyboard keys or joysticks.</li><li>You can simultaneously simulate the fake GPS on up to 5 Android or iOS devices.</li><li>Import GPX route files and save them for your subsequent use.</li></ul><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong></p><p>Available for Windows and Mac computers.</p><ul><li>You can use the tool to spoof your location on Android and iOS devices.</li><li>Fully support the latest iOS 16&#x2F;Android 13.</li></ul><p><strong>iTools Virtual Location Plan and Pricing:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>1 Bundled Package, one PC</strong>: US$ 59.95 (up to 5 devices)</li><li><strong>Premium License, 5 PC</strong>: US$ 34.95 (up to 5 devices)</li><li><strong>Platinum License, 15 PC</strong>: US$ 69.95 (up to 5 devices)</li><li><strong>Contact iTools Virtual Location vendor to get offers on bundled packages.</strong></li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-iTools-Virtual-Location-to-Fake-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-iTools-Virtual-Location-to-Fake-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It means that absolute online privacy as well as anonymity. VPN connects you to a server of your preference, which enables you to bypass all geo-restrictions for the desired content access. To simply put, a VPN helps you to unblock streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, etc outside your country and content access worldwide.</p><p>There are so many options available for VPN out there, so choosing the ideal one is a bit challenging. However, you can pick any popular options that support platform - Apple iPhone SE (2022).  You can get ExpressVPN, IPVanish or NordVPN to fake the location on your Apple iPhone SE (2022).</p><p>Here’s a quick guide on how to use VPN to fake or change location on the Apple iPhone SE (2022):</p><p>(We have taken NordVPN as an example)</p><p>Step 1: Register with NordVPN by going to its official website.</p><p>Step 2: Get the NordVPN app on your Apple iPhone SE (2022).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/NordVPN-download.jpg"                      alt="NordVPN download"                ></p><p>Step 3: Run the app and sign-in with your login details.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Quick Connect and give permissions the app asked to connect to the VPN. In a while, you’ll view a map that shows various servers worldwide.</p><p>Step 5: To change location, select the ‘Map &#x2F;List” view - you can click on the country or region you want to set. For instance, swipe across the map until you see the UK. Then, you need to click on the server icon in the mid of that region to connect to the UK region.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/VPN.jpg"                      alt="VPN download"                ></p><p>That’s it. Now, you will be available to access the content that is available in that region.</p><h2 id="FAQs-You-May-Want-to-Know"><a href="#FAQs-You-May-Want-to-Know" class="headerlink" title="FAQs You May Want to Know"></a>FAQs You May Want to Know</h2><p><strong>1. How do I <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-location/how-to-change-weather-location-ipad.html" >change weather location on Apple iPhone SE (2022) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</strong></p><p>If you have changed your location or the app misperceives your location, follow these steps and get accurate weather updates:</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Go to your iDevice’s weather widget and long-press to choose the “Edit Weather” option. Now, tap “My Location” to check your current location. If it’s wrong and you want to change it, type and select the exact one in the “Search” bar. This way, your weather location will be changed on the weather app on your Apple iPhone SE (2022).</p><p><strong>2. Will changing my location affect my device’s warranty or performance?</strong></p><p>The device’s warranty generally depends on the product and has nothing to do with moving locations. Yet it’s advisable to check the terms and conditions of the warranty. You can check if those conditions cover your device regardless of location. In short, changing location will not affect your phone, but you should note its local regulations.</p><p><strong>3. Is there a risk of my account being banned in certain apps or games if I change my location?</strong></p><p>Yes, you might encounter issues in certain apps if you change location on your Apple iPhone SE (2022). This is because some apps have terms that prohibit falsifying locations. If they observe a rapid change in location due to VPN, it could lead to a ban to maintain fair play. To avoid this issue, always use a legitimate means of updating locations and be familiar with other terms.</p><p><strong>4. How do I change my location back to my real one?</strong></p><p>If you have faked your location on your Apple iPhone SE (2022) for certain games and applications, check the settings of your location spoofer. Within the app settings, you can revert to your actual location. Apart from that, if you are using a VPN to change location, disconnect from it. Upon turning it off, your device will return to the real location.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>In this guide, you have learned how to <strong>change location on the Apple iPhone SE (2022)</strong> in different scenarios.

User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location</h2><p>One of the best indicators of an online tool’s efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics.

To simulate its movement, you can click on the Multi-stop or One-stop Mode icons from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="one stop mode"                ></p><p>You can now drop the pin in a route on the map and click on the “Move Here” Button to start simulating the movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="simulate movement"                ></p><p>Subsequently, you can select the number of times you want to cover the route and click on the “March” button. The application will even let you select a preferred speed for the movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png"                      alt="select the speed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Export or Import the GPX Files</strong></p><p>Once you have loaded the map on the interface, you can easily save it offline as a GPX file. To do that, just click on the Export icon from the floating menu on the side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/save-one-stop-route.png"                      alt="save one stop route"                ></p><p>Similarly, you can also import a GPX file directly to the Dr.Fone application. To do this, you just have to click on the “Import” icon from the sidebar. This will open a browser window, letting you go to a location on your computer where the GPX file is saved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/import-gpx.png"                      alt="import gpx file"                ></p><p>Once the GPX file is loaded, you can simply wait for a while and let the application process it without closing it in between.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/wait-import-gpx.png"                      alt="wait import gpx"                ></p><p>As you can see, it is pretty easy to view GPX online or offline using the right tools. In this post, I have included a detailed guide on how to view GPX in Google Maps. Besides that, I have also included another solution to view GPX on a map using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (iOS). Apart from importing&#x2F;exporting GPX files, the application can also be used to spoof your Apple iPhone 7’s location or simulate its movement virtually from anywhere you want.</p><h2 id="Why-Does-iTools-Virtual-Location-Not-Work-For-Apple-iPhone-7-iPad-Solved"><a href="#Why-Does-iTools-Virtual-Location-Not-Work-For-Apple-iPhone-7-iPad-Solved" class="headerlink" title="Why Does iTools Virtual Location Not Work For Apple iPhone 7&#x2F;iPad?

In particular, we will discuss how it works, its benefits, and how to use the software to spoof your Location. Importantly, we will discern the top 5 iTools Virtual Location alternatives. In case you do not like what iTools offers, you can pick one of the iTools alternatives and spoof your location in the same manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/itool-virtual-location.jpg"                      alt="itool virtual location logo"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Overview-of-iTools-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-1-Overview-of-iTools-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

You can also play games like Pokemon Go from the comfort of your home and still have all the best Pokemon in your collection.</p><p>The Virtual Location feature of iTools works by spoofing the GPS data of your Apple devices. To get into technicalities, when you select a different location, your device will send false GPS coordinates to other applications and services. This will trick the application into thinking you are in a different location.</p><p>All in all, iTools Virtual Location presents a simple range of features and a very straightforward interface. This means even the least tech-literates can use iTools Virtual Location conveniently, access restricted content, and play location-based games like Pokemon Go seamlessly.</p><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li>You can change the location on your Apple iPhone 6s or iPad without rooting or jailbreaking the Apple iPhone 6s device.</li><li>You can change the GPS location on your Apple iPhone 6s and iPad within a few clicks.</li><li>Play location-based games like Pokemon Go and AR games from the comfort of your home.</li><li>Simulate the GPS movements using keyboard keys or joysticks.</li><li>You can simultaneously simulate the fake GPS on up to 5 Android or iOS devices.</li><li>Import GPX route files and save them for your subsequent use.</li></ul><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong></p><p>Available for Windows and Mac computers.</p><ul><li>You can use the tool to spoof your location on Android and iOS devices.</li><li>Fully support the latest iOS 16&#x2F;Android 13.</li></ul><p><strong>iTools Virtual Location Plan and Pricing:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>1 Bundled Package, one PC</strong>: US$ 59.95 (up to 5 devices)</li><li><strong>Premium License, 5 PC</strong>: US$ 34.95 (up to 5 devices)</li><li><strong>Platinum License, 15 PC</strong>: US$ 69.95 (up to 5 devices)</li><li><strong>Contact iTools Virtual Location vendor to get offers on bundled packages.</strong></li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-iTools-Virtual-Location-to-Fake-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-6s"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-iTools-Virtual-Location-to-Fake-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-6s" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location"></a>Part 3. User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location</h2><p>One of the best indicators of an online tool’s efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics. We did not thoroughly enjoy using the iTools Virtual Location ourselves. And that is because it does not include advanced features as the iTools Virtual Location alternatives mentioned here. Nevertheless, it is also good to look at other users’ feedback, so here are a few reviews from iTools users:</p><p><strong>Sri Viswakarma (Content Manager, Greenland LLC.)</strong></p><p><strong>Ratings: 4.8&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**I recently started using the iTools Virtual Location application, and I am impressed that it delivers on its promise.

While using the app, encountering messages like “No Location Found” or “Location Not Available” could be quite challenging. Understanding the distinctions between these messages within the Find My app is crucial for effectively managing and understanding location information.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the differences between “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” within the Find My app on Apple iPhone 6s and will potentially address solutions to these problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-1.jpg"                      alt="find my app issues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>If you are an Apple iPhone 6s user and frequently use the Find My app to track the location of your devices or loved ones, you may have come across the frustrating message that says “Location Not Available.” This error can leave you puzzled and wondering why you are unable to see the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 6s device you are tracking.</p><h3 id="1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error"><a href="#1-1-Understanding-the-“Location-Not-Available”-Error" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error"></a>1.1 Understanding the “Location Not Available” Error</h3><p>iPhone returning with the error “Location Not Available” involves issues caused by the Apple iPhone 6s device’s GPS. “Location Not Available” in the Find My app typically means that the Apple iPhone 6s device you are trying to locate is either turned off, not connected to the internet, or has disabled location services.</p><p>When a device is turned off or not connected to the internet, it cannot send its location information to the Find My app, thus resulting in the “Location Not Available” message. Similarly, if the Apple iPhone 6s device has disabled location services, it will not be able to provide its location to the app. It’s important to note that this message does not necessarily mean that the Apple iPhone 6s device is lost or stolen, but rather that it is unable to be tracked at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-2.jpg"                      alt="location not available error"                ></p><h3 id="1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6s-Say-“Location-Not-Available”"><a href="#1-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6s-Say-“Location-Not-Available”" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Say, “Location Not Available”?"></a>1.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Say, “Location Not Available”?</h3><p>The “Location Not Available” message can appear on the Find My app for various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One common reason for this error is that the Apple iPhone 6s device you are trying to locate has its location services turned off. Location services are essential for apps like Find My to accurately determine the Apple iPhone 6s device’s location. To resolve this issue, the Apple iPhone 6s device owner needs to enable location services in their device settings.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Poor or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>The Find My app relies on a stable internet connection to transmit location data. If the Apple iPhone 6s device you are tracking is in an area with weak or no internet connectivity, the app may not be able to retrieve the location information. Encourage the Apple iPhone 6s device owner to check their internet connection and try again later. In another case, it might be possible that your phone’s Airplane Mode is turned on, with the Wi-Fi services and cellular data turned off for the Apple iPhone 6s.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Incorrect Date and Time Settings</strong></li></ul><p>The “Date &amp; Time Settings” of the Apple iPhone 6s are not set properly. You may have tried to manually set the date, time, and the appropriate zone that the Apple iPhone 6s has to follow. Technical anomalies across the settings will cause issues with the Apple iPhone 6s device’s location settings.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Privacy Settings</strong></li></ul><p>Apple prioritizes user privacy, and as a result, users have control over sharing their location information. If the person you are trying to locate has set their privacy settings to restrict location sharing, you will receive a “Location Not Available” message. In this case, the Apple iPhone 6s device owner needs to adjust their privacy settings to allow location sharing with the Find My app.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Device Turned Off or Battery Depleted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Apple iPhone 6s device you are tracking is turned off or its battery has completely drained, the Find My app will not be able to provide the location information. This is a common occurrence when trying to locate a lost or stolen device. In such cases, you may need to wait until the Apple iPhone 6s device is turned on or charged to retrieve its location.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Problems with Application or Device</strong></li></ul><p>Occasionally, technical glitches or temporary server issues can cause the “Location Not Available” error, which will require a restart of the Apple iPhone 6s device. System issues can also cause glitches in functions like the location settings of the Apple iPhone 6s, which need to be restarted. If the error persists for an extended period, it may be worth contacting Apple support for further assistance.</p><p>In conclusion, the “Location Not Available” error in the Find My app can be caused by a variety of factors, including disabled location services, poor internet connection, privacy settings, device status, or technical glitches. By understanding these possible reasons, you can troubleshoot the issue more effectively and ensure a seamless tracking experience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-“No-Location-Found”-Mean-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?"></a>Part 2: What Does “No Location Found” Mean in Find My App?</h2><p>The Find My app is a useful tool that allows you to locate your Apple iPhone 6s, iPad, or other Apple devices.

Conveniently speaking, this error displays the unavailability of a location for an Apple iPhone 6s, which is why it shows such an error. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to locate a lost or stolen device. However, there are several reasons why this error may occur, and understanding them will help you troubleshoot the issue effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-3.jpg"                      alt="no location found error"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6s-Say-“No-Location-Found”"><a href="#2-2-Why-Does-My-Apple-iPhone-6s-Say-“No-Location-Found”" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Say, “No Location Found”?"></a>2.2 Why Does My Apple iPhone 6s Say, “No Location Found”?</h3><p>There are a few common reasons why your Apple iPhone 6s may display the “No Location Found” error message. In this section, we will explore these reasons and provide solutions to help you resolve the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Location Services Disabled</strong></li></ul><p>One possible reason for the “No Location Found” error is that your Location Services are disabled. To check if this is the case, go to your Apple iPhone 6s’s Settings, tap on Privacy, and select Location Services. Ensure that the toggle switch is turned on for both the Find My app and any other apps that require location access.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Location Not Being Shared</strong></li></ul><p>If you cannot find the location of your friend across the Find My App, there is a possibility that they’ve stopped sharing the location at any time. When this happens, you won’t be able to check out their live location coordinates, as the other user has voluntarily abstained from the option of showing their location to someone else.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Device Ran Out of Battery</strong></li></ul><p>iPhones are Apple iPhone 6s] and other smartphones that can run out of battery. While the Apple iPhone 6s needs to be activated to communicate properly, having the Apple iPhone 6s run out of battery leaves with this error when their location is searched. The Find My app would duly fail to access the Apple iPhone 6s device when it runs out of battery.</p><ul><li><strong>4. iCloud Removed from Device</strong></li></ul><p>Your iCloud account plays a crucial role in the Find My app’s functionality. Apple iPhone 6s provides the “Share My Location” option for Find My users who have connected their iCloud account with their device.</p><p>If somehow they remove the iCloud account from their phone, all connections with the Apple iPhone 6s are deleted. This also includes the Find My service, which eliminates the location services from the Apple iPhone 6s device. You would now be unable to observe any location coordinates of the Apple iPhone 6s device. Sign out of your iCloud account, restart your device, and sign back in to refresh the connection. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled Find My Apple iPhone 6s in your iCloud settings.</p><ul><li><strong>5. Poor GPS Signal or No Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>Another reason for the error message could be a weak GPS signal or lack of internet connectivity. Your Apple iPhone 6s relies on GPS and internet connection to accurately determine its location. If you’re in an area with poor GPS signal or have no internet connection, your device may struggle to find its location. Try moving to an open space or connecting to a stable internet network to see if the issue resolves.</p><ul><li><strong>6. Outdated iOS Version</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, an outdated iOS version can cause issues with location services. Ensure that your Apple iPhone 6s is running on the latest iOS version by going to Settings, selecting General, and tapping on Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it to potentially fix any bugs or glitches affecting the Find My app’s location tracking.</p><ul><li><strong>7. Find My Not Working Properly</strong></li></ul><p>Glitches in the Find My service can also cause the problem of the “No Location Found” error with the Apple iPhone 6s. You won’t get any location results if the primary source has issues that cannot be quickly resolved. At times, this directs back to the server, which might take some time to correct.</p><p>Encountering the “No Location Found” error on your Apple iPhone 6s’s Find My app can be frustrating, but with the information provided in this part, you now have a better understanding of why it occurs and how to troubleshoot it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App"><a href="#Part-3-“No-Location-Found”-vs-“Location-Not-Available”-in-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App"></a>Part 3: “No Location Found” vs. “Location Not Available” in Find My App</h2><p>The “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available” errors have a very thin line of difference among them.

In particular, we will discuss how it works, its benefits, and how to use the software to spoof your Location. Importantly, we will discern the top 5 iTools Virtual Location alternatives.

You can also play games like Pokemon Go from the comfort of your home and still have all the best Pokemon in your collection.</p><p>The Virtual Location feature of iTools works by spoofing the GPS data of your Apple devices.

This will trick the application into thinking you are in a different location.</p><p>All in all, iTools Virtual Location presents a simple range of features and a very straightforward interface. This means even the least tech-literates can use iTools Virtual Location conveniently, access restricted content, and play location-based games like Pokemon Go seamlessly.</p><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li>You can change the location on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus or iPad without rooting or jailbreaking the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device.</li><li>You can change the GPS location on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus and iPad within a few clicks.</li><li>Play location-based games like Pokemon Go and AR games from the comfort of your home.</li><li>Simulate the GPS movements using keyboard keys or joysticks.</li><li>You can simultaneously simulate the fake GPS on up to 5 Android or iOS devices.</li><li>Import GPX route files and save them for your subsequent use.</li></ul><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong></p><p>Available for Windows and Mac computers.</p><ul><li>You can use the tool to spoof your location on Android and iOS devices.</li><li>Fully support the latest iOS 16&#x2F;Android 13.</li></ul><p><strong>iTools Virtual Location Plan and Pricing:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>1 Bundled Package, one PC</strong>: US$ 59.95 (up to 5 devices)</li><li><strong>Premium License, 5 PC</strong>: US$ 34.95 (up to 5 devices)</li><li><strong>Platinum License, 15 PC</strong>: US$ 69.95 (up to 5 devices)</li><li><strong>Contact iTools Virtual Location vendor to get offers on bundled packages.</strong></li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-iTools-Virtual-Location-to-Fake-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-iTools-Virtual-Location-to-Fake-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location"></a>Part 3. User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location</h2><p>One of the best indicators of an online tool’s efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics. We did not thoroughly enjoy using the iTools Virtual Location ourselves. And that is because it does not include advanced features as the iTools Virtual Location alternatives mentioned here. Nevertheless, it is also good to look at other users’ feedback, so here are a few reviews from iTools users:</p><p><strong>Sri Viswakarma (Content Manager, Greenland LLC.)</strong></p><p><strong>Ratings: 4.8&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**I recently started using the iTools Virtual Location application, and I am impressed that it delivers on its promise.

User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location</h2><p>One of the best indicators of an online tool’s efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics.

However, the newer versions (Android 6.0 and later) do not allow you to change the location without rooting. iTools Virtual Location cannot help you in this regard.</p><p>However, some applications like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allow you to change the location on Android 6.0 and later versions conveniently.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>iTools Virtual Location, all in all, is a comprehensive program and is equipped with all the necessary tools that one might look for in a GPS spoofing application. It allows you to move automatically, manually, and at different speeds. You can also mark the Pins in a route and make the simulation look genuine. However, the problem forces you to purchase the full Toolset to use the application. You have to pay US$ 59.95 to use one function of the tool. Aside from that, it does not use advanced algorithms, so some apps might crash or not work with iTools Virtual Location.</p><p>And that’s why we include the five best iTools Virtual Location alternatives. You can choose any of the five as they have nearly the features that iTools Virtual Location does. The first one in the alternative list, the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , is the most significant location changer in the market. It costs nearly 5x lower than iTools Virtual Location and offers more features. Plus, it is more sophisticated and simple to use compared to iTools.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/why-does-itools-virtual-location-not-work-for-apple-iphone-xs-maxipad-solved-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Why Does iTools Virtual Location Not Work For Apple iPhone XS Max/iPad?

In particular, we will discuss how it works, its benefits, and how to use the software to spoof your Location. Importantly, we will discern the top 5 iTools Virtual Location alternatives.

You can also play games like Pokemon Go from the comfort of your home and still have all the best Pokemon in your collection.</p><p>The Virtual Location feature of iTools works by spoofing the GPS data of your Apple devices.

In particular, we will discuss how it works, its benefits, and how to use the software to spoof your Location. Importantly, we will discern the top 5 iTools Virtual Location alternatives. In case you do not like what iTools offers, you can pick one of the iTools alternatives and spoof your location in the same manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/02/itool-virtual-location.jpg"                      alt="itool virtual location logo"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Overview-of-iTools-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-1-Overview-of-iTools-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location"></a>Part 3. User Reviews for iTools Virtual Location</h2><p>One of the best indicators of an online tool’s efficiency is user reviews and comments from Tech critics. We did not thoroughly enjoy using the iTools Virtual Location ourselves. And that is because it does not include advanced features as the iTools Virtual Location alternatives mentioned here. Nevertheless, it is also good to look at other users’ feedback, so here are a few reviews from iTools users:</p><p><strong>Sri Viswakarma (Content Manager, Greenland LLC.)</strong></p><p><strong>Ratings: 4.8&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**I recently started using the iTools Virtual Location application, and I am impressed that it delivers on its promise. The price is quite high compared to other GPS location changes in the market, but during the Trial version of the tool, iTool’s simple interface stuck with me. It’s reliable, and I love how it lets me access location-restricted content. I recommend the iTools Virtual Location to anyone looking to change their GPS location on their Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max conveniently.”</p><p><strong>Kat Napiorkowska (Self-employed)</strong></p><p><strong>Rating: 2.3&#x2F;5.</strong></p><p>**”**After reading the good description of the iTools Virtual Location from the vendor, I was really excited to try the application. But I have to say that I am quite disappointed with iTools Virtual Location. I was really excited to try iTools Virtual Location, but I have to say I am quite disappointed with the app. In my opinion, the application’s user interface is quite confusing, and I found it difficult to navigate. I also experienced some bugs and crashes while using the app, which was frustrating. The location-changing feature didn’t seem to work well for me, as the new location wasn’t accurate or consistent. I was hoping for a reliable and efficient tool, but unfortunately, iTools Virtual Location did not meet my expectations. I would not recommend this app to others.”</p><h2 id="Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-iTools-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-iTools-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.
