Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Indoor TV antennas, like the AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna, can provide you with free broadcast TV channels. Once you pay the upfront cost for the antenna you’re not stuck with any monthly fees for your local channels. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are nothing like the bunny ear style antennas from back in the day. The picture quality is comparable to what you’d get from the cable company or streaming service—or it’s supposed to be. I tested the ultra-affordable AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna for a week to see if its design, setup, and performance make it a viable option.</p><h2 id="Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic"><a href="#Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic" class="headerlink" title="Design: It’s all in the name (basic)"></a><strong>Design: It’s all in the name (basic)</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna has a slim design—it’s about as thin as card stock at approximately one-tenth of an inch in thickness. It’s constructed of sturdy plastic, with a reversible black and white side to help it fit better with your home’s decor. It’s not the most attractive antenna, and the backboards smudge and show grease and fingerprints.</p><p> It doesn’t come with a stand, but it does include 3M double-sided adhesives you can use to attach the antenna to walls or other surfaces. It also comes with a 10-foot long coax cable, which is removable. The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><p> The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><h2 id="Setup-Relatively-easy"><a href="#Setup-Relatively-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Relatively easy"></a><strong>Setup: Relatively easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the antenna is pretty straightforward. You start by plugging one end of the coaxial cable into the antenna, and then the other end to the coaxial&#x2F;antenna-in connector to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Finding the best placement for the antenna is perhaps the most difficult part, as a few inches can make a difference in your available channel selection. My test home is under a canopy of trees in a pretty rural area, and I found the best placement was on the window. Ideally, you’ll want to direct the antenna towards tower transmitters, while also doing your best to reduce obstacles (think trees, electrical interference, and walls). You’ll want to place the antenna high up as well.</p><p> Next, you change your TV to the correct input (usually TV, antenna, or Coax). Then, go to your TV’s menus and start the auto-programming process, which<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >scans for available channels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The process takes a few minutes, and sometimes your TV won’t start to locate channels until about halfway through the auto-programming process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/z_YIDnD2uHBFyEpRQlkQ1HUaA_8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-2-e19a3a09a82f438d8f902ded5b0fecd4.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006118/18460" target="_top" id="2006118"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006118"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006118/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area"><a href="#Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)"></a><strong>Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)</strong></h2><p> So many things<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >affect an antenna’s performance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —location, household electronics, tree cover, tower location, and more. The antenna displays channels of high quality. However, sometimes the channels would take a few seconds to load, and other times, I’d see a pixelated effect when I first changed the channel that would clear up after a few seconds. Once the picture was fully loaded, it was in clear high definition. The antenna is capable of displaying a clear HD picture, so I couldn’t tell the difference between the antenna’s picture and the picture from streaming services like Hulu or Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GRXmDZjwX-_X2TyOZoHytHKrjDY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-3-70b77c023b7049ef985c61cf6f5064ad.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993650">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993650">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993650%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993650/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537547&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/vcfpro.png"                      border="0"                >Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-35-miles"><a href="#Range-35-miles" class="headerlink" title="Range: 35 miles"></a><strong>Range: 35 miles</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics antenna has a 35-mile range, which isn’t very far considering 50 plus miles is becoming more common. It is omnidirectional, however, so you don’t need to point it in a specific direction. It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><p> Even with the short-range, I was able to pick up 16 channels on my first attempt, including The CW, PBS, and more. In a different room in my test home, I was able to get 23 channels, but this is probably because there’s less tree cover outside of the house on that side of the property. Considering the location of my test home, 23 channels is pretty good.</p><p> It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2337838&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="640" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzZwphIv4RM" title="APFill - Ink and Toner Coverage Calculator" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Super-affordable"><a href="#Price-Super-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Super affordable"></a><strong>Price: Super affordable</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Flat TV antenna sells in used condition on Amazon for only $13.

With the AmazonBasics model, you can return the unit within 30 days if it doesn’t work in your area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MN6DSsu9Myyo6CdrSW5MJTjHoug=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-4-fd9968307cb44c9d9e824750413e0028.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna"><a href="#AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna"></a><strong>AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 (see<a class="link"   href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/ANTOP-Omni-Directional-Indoor-HD-UHF-VHF-TV-Antenna/1000503257" >online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a 40-mile range antenna that sells for around $35. It’s one of the better-looking antennas I’ve seen, as it’s reversible with faux light wood and dark wood sides. Unlike the AmazonBasics antenna, the Antop comes with a stand, and it has an easy-push connector for faster setup. These features go some ways towards justifying the Antop’s higher price tag.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A budget antenna that works as advertised.</strong></p><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna is a good option for anyone who wants an ultra-cheap way to get broadcast TV.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Indoor TV antennas, like the AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna, can provide you with free broadcast TV channels. Once you pay the upfront cost for the antenna you’re not stuck with any monthly fees for your local channels. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are nothing like the bunny ear style antennas from back in the day. The picture quality is comparable to what you’d get from the cable company or streaming service—or it’s supposed to be. I tested the ultra-affordable AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna for a week to see if its design, setup, and performance make it a viable option.</p><h2 id="Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic"><a href="#Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic" class="headerlink" title="Design: It’s all in the name (basic)"></a><strong>Design: It’s all in the name (basic)</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna has a slim design—it’s about as thin as card stock at approximately one-tenth of an inch in thickness. It’s constructed of sturdy plastic, with a reversible black and white side to help it fit better with your home’s decor. It’s not the most attractive antenna, and the backboards smudge and show grease and fingerprints.</p><p> It doesn’t come with a stand, but it does include 3M double-sided adhesives you can use to attach the antenna to walls or other surfaces. It also comes with a 10-foot long coax cable, which is removable. The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><p> The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><h2 id="Setup-Relatively-easy"><a href="#Setup-Relatively-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Relatively easy"></a><strong>Setup: Relatively easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the antenna is pretty straightforward. You start by plugging one end of the coaxial cable into the antenna, and then the other end to the coaxial&#x2F;antenna-in connector to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Finding the best placement for the antenna is perhaps the most difficult part, as a few inches can make a difference in your available channel selection. My test home is under a canopy of trees in a pretty rural area, and I found the best placement was on the window. Ideally, you’ll want to direct the antenna towards tower transmitters, while also doing your best to reduce obstacles (think trees, electrical interference, and walls). You’ll want to place the antenna high up as well.</p><p> Next, you change your TV to the correct input (usually TV, antenna, or Coax). Then, go to your TV’s menus and start the auto-programming process, which<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >scans for available channels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The process takes a few minutes, and sometimes your TV won’t start to locate channels until about halfway through the auto-programming process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/z_YIDnD2uHBFyEpRQlkQ1HUaA_8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-2-e19a3a09a82f438d8f902ded5b0fecd4.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area"><a href="#Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)"></a><strong>Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)</strong></h2><p> So many things<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >affect an antenna’s performance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —location, household electronics, tree cover, tower location, and more. The antenna displays channels of high quality. However, sometimes the channels would take a few seconds to load, and other times, I’d see a pixelated effect when I first changed the channel that would clear up after a few seconds. Once the picture was fully loaded, it was in clear high definition. The antenna is capable of displaying a clear HD picture, so I couldn’t tell the difference between the antenna’s picture and the picture from streaming services like Hulu or Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GRXmDZjwX-_X2TyOZoHytHKrjDY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-3-70b77c023b7049ef985c61cf6f5064ad.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://thefitville.pxf.io/c/5597632/1526796/15852" target="_top" id="1526796"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1526796"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1526796/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Project-Manager-3D-Models-4-800x800.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-35-miles"><a href="#Range-35-miles" class="headerlink" title="Range: 35 miles"></a><strong>Range: 35 miles</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics antenna has a 35-mile range, which isn’t very far considering 50 plus miles is becoming more common. It is omnidirectional, however, so you don’t need to point it in a specific direction. It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><p> Even with the short-range, I was able to pick up 16 channels on my first attempt, including The CW, PBS, and more. In a different room in my test home, I was able to get 23 channels, but this is probably because there’s less tree cover outside of the house on that side of the property. Considering the location of my test home, 23 channels is pretty good.</p><p> It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37100474&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://awario.com/images/pages/index/img-platform-ui-1280@1x.avif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Super-affordable"><a href="#Price-Super-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Super affordable"></a><strong>Price: Super affordable</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Flat TV antenna sells in used condition on Amazon for only $13. In new condition, it sells for $20, which is still a great deal. However, you can find other affordable antennas for between $20 and $50 that provide a much longer range, and many offer additional features, like a longer cable.

It’s one of the better-looking antennas I’ve seen, as it’s reversible with faux light wood and dark wood sides. Unlike the AmazonBasics antenna, the Antop comes with a stand, and it has an easy-push connector for faster setup. These features go some ways towards justifying the Antop’s higher price tag.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A budget antenna that works as advertised.</strong></p><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna is a good option for anyone who wants an ultra-cheap way to get broadcast TV.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Ultra-Thin Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  AmazonBasics</li><li>SKU  DVB-T9088</li><li>Price  $20.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.09 x 13.31 x 0.075 in.</li><li>Warranty  30 day return policy, One year limited warranty</li><li>Resolution  1080p</li><li>Range  35 miles</li><li>Frequency  174-230 MHz</li><li>Receiving range  VHF&#x2F;UHF</li><li>Atenna version  Passive</li><li>Ports  Coax</li><li>Cable length  10-foot Coax Cable</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mobile-and-desktop-tips-for-gotomeeting-captures/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mobile & Desktop Tips for GoToMeeting Captures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-a-step-by-step-guide-to-mastering-magix-video-pro-x/"><u>[New] A Step-by-Step Guide to Mastering Magix Video Pro X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-emulate-hand-held-shooting-effects-in-ps/"><u>[New] Emulate Hand-Held Shooting Effects in PS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-navigating-through-mixed-reality-an-overview/"><u>[New] In 2024, Navigating Through Mixed Reality  An Overview</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-perfecting-your-xbox-one-gaming-archive/"><u>[New] Perfecting Your Xbox One Gaming Archive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-whos-watching-your-guide-to-instagram-eye-rolls-count/"><u>[New] Who's Watching?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Fellowes Microban Split Design Wired Keyboard is one of several Fellowes’ products geared towards businesses, thanks to its comfortable, ergonomic design and budget-friendly pricing. The inclusion of Microban antimicrobial protection technology, designed to prolong the life of your computer hardware by preventing damaging microbes from building up over time and causing deterioration, is an added bonus for the price. We tested this keyboard for over a week so read on to see what we discovered.</p><h2 id="Design-Cleaner-than-the-rest"><a href="#Design-Cleaner-than-the-rest" class="headerlink" title="Design: Cleaner than the rest"></a><strong>Design: Cleaner than the rest</strong></h2><p> Ergonomic keyboards are designed to encourage natural, neutral movements that put less strain on wrists and shoulders,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >preventing repetitive stress injuries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over time. This is especially important for people who spend large portions of their day in a home or office setting tethered to their computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/WPjeQmKmzof_KVFE5_fIwN92cXc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fellowes_ErgoKeyboard_3LW4147386_05-24f7f07146ae45cd86d2c5bdd4791ee5.jpg"                      alt="Fellowes Microban Split Design Wired Keyboard"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> Unfortunately, some larger keyboards can trade wrist injuries for shoulder injuries as their users overreach for mice, which brings a whole new set of problems to the table. While it may be a bit of a space hog, and not a terribly sleek or attractive one at that, the Fellowes Microban Split Wired Keyboard has solved both of these issues. What’s more, its ergonomic split design is easy to use and surprisingly comfortable.</p><p> The Fellowes Microban Split Wired Keyboard is wide, sitting at a whopping 19.25 inches, and it’s long and tall, too, with a length of 9.75 inches and a height of 2.25 inches. Risers on the backside of the keyboard boost this up an additional inch if desired. It employs a fairly standard swoop design we often see with ergonomic keyboards, but with a distinct divot in the keys that makes for easy gripping while typing. The keys also have additional spacing between them compared to competitor models, which is nice once you get used to it.</p><p> We were disappointed that it didn’t include hotkeys for pausing, skipping forward, or skipping backward in multimedia.</p><p> Unlike competitor models which often use a mix of fabric, plastics, and in some instances, metals, the entirety of this keyboard is plastic—even down to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-keyboard-wrist-rests-4172684" >wrist pad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . While we did wish that the wrist pad was made of a more comfortable material, it wasn’t uncomfortable during use. Plus, a different material would likely impact the keyboard’s longevity, since the Microban antimicrobial coating needs to be put on an acrylic, non-porous surface in order to protect against common bacteria, yeasts, molds, and fungi.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mushroom-supplies.sjv.io/c/5597632/1692242/18134" target="_top" id="1692242"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18134-1692242"                      border="0" alt="" width="834" height="592"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1692242/18134"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Plug and play"></a><strong>Setup Process: Plug and play</strong></h2><p> The keyboard doesn’t arrive with much. It comes in a mid-size box with the keyboard itself and an accessory pamphlet that addresses some frequently asked questions regarding Microban technology. Setting up is quite easy. It’s a plug and play device, which means that when the keyboard is connected to the computer, the computer will recognize the device is there and you can begin using it immediately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NycF2nKeSim8iDJ0Yp1gejyIigI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fellowes_ErgoKeyboard_3LW4147386_03-49fdaa8e182941e184cadafc14281a1e.jpg"                      alt="Fellowes Microban Split Design Wired Keyboard"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254762&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/11_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Features-Multimedia-hotkeys-for-ease-of-use"><a href="#Features-Multimedia-hotkeys-for-ease-of-use" class="headerlink" title="Features: Multimedia hotkeys for ease of use"></a><strong>Features: Multimedia hotkeys for ease of use</strong></h2><p> The Fellowes features seven hotkeys for multimedia playback. These keys are located along the top of the keyboard and offer such functionality as mute, volume up, volume down, sleep, email, search, and one-touch internet access. We were disappointed that it didn’t include hotkeys for pausing, skipping forward, or skipping backward in multimedia.</p><h2 id="Connectivity-A-wired-connection-for-reliability"><a href="#Connectivity-A-wired-connection-for-reliability" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: A wired connection for reliability"></a><strong>Connectivity: A wired connection for reliability</strong></h2><p> The Fellowes connects to a PC via a USB cord. We couldn’t help but appreciate the simplicity of this design choice, especially as more and more companies are looking for ways to cut cords. Cutting down on cables is great when it makes sense, but the corded connection here allows for a dependable product, since you never have to worry about a low battery, and also means that the keyboard is more reliable for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/typing-speed-tests-1356663" >faster typists <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It’s equipped with a 16-character buffer, which means that it can hold onto that many typed characters before they’re processed.

The Fellowes Microban Split Wired Keyboard tends to retail for around $50, which puts this well at the budget end. Its low price point makes it a great introductory ergonomic keyboard, particularly if you’re unsure of what you want and are experimenting with different design choices.</p><h2 id="Fellowes-Microban-Split-Design-Wired-Keyboard-vs-Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard"><a href="#Fellowes-Microban-Split-Design-Wired-Keyboard-vs-Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="Fellowes Microban Split Design Wired Keyboard vs. Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"></a><strong>Fellowes Microban Split Design Wired Keyboard vs. Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard</strong></h2><p> The Fellowes keyboard faces stiff competition from other companies, notably Microsoft, which has been in the computer game for decades. Here, the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard is the main competition. Generally retailing for around $80, nearly double the price of the Fellowes, the Sculpt follows a unique design akin to that of a manta ray. The two halves of the keyboard swoop upward, rising toward the middle, but not quite meeting thanks to an unfilled space between them. It looks strange, but it’s quite comfortable, especially thanks to its fabric wrist pad for extra comfort.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-review-4780274" >Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9Ei30bgFst4sw8SynCxgEI_b-9I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fellowes_ErgoKeyboard_3LW4147386_04-eff22d3b32274568890dd291e56daab5.jpg"                      alt="Fellowes Microban Split Design Wired Keyboard"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2095385/26400" target="_top" id="2095385"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2095385"                      border="0" alt="" width="1024" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2095385/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> The Sculpt is also a wireless keyboard. It uses Bluetooth technology to pair to the keyboard to your PC. One drawback to this design, however, is that the dongle used to pair the keyboard to the PC is linked with the keyboard at the time of build. If it’s lost or damaged, there’s simply no replacing it. It also lacks the pronounced divot in the keys that the Fellowes possesses, and the Sculpt doesn’t include Microban technology to prolong the keyboard’s lifespan.</p><p> The Microban antimicrobial coating needs to be put on an acrylic, non-porous surface in order to protect against common bacteria, yeasts, molds, and fungi.</p><p> A neat perk of the Sculpt, in contrast to the Fellowes, is that the Sculpt has a detached numpad and a magnetic riser is also provided. With these combined features, there are multiple customization options regarding setup. If you’re on the market for something built to last, the Fellowes is the clear winner, but if you’re looking for an ergonomic keyboard with multiple customization options or additional comfort, the Sculpt is the keyboard for you.</p><p> Want to take a look at some other options?

Its antimicrobial protection not only keeps germs, fungi, and bacteria at bay, but ensures the keyboard won’t deteriorate over time.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Just like the iPhone, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-models-4175232" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has become a reliably annualized device, with a new and upgraded version releasing every year to replace the previous edition. The new model always carries a premium price tag, so usually Apple keeps an older version around at a lower price. But Apple did something a bit different in 2020.</p><p> Alongside the new Apple Watch Series 6 comes the also-new Apple Watch SE, a more affordable model that acts as a hybrid of features from previous editions. It has the processor of the Series 5, but not the always-on display or wellness-related sensors of the Series 6—but it costs $120 less than the current top model. All told, the Apple Watch SE is still a capable smartwatch for those who can live with the omissions, but if you’re considering an Apple Watch, which version is really worth your cash?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dYbtlOWZtDlcrgt0HTrqvqhQsLA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Apple-Watch-SE-Smart-Watch-5-541e573360624431bbe5d793abb99ed4.jpeg"                      alt="Apple Watch SE"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1468905&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_728x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Design-and-Display-One-big-change"><a href="#Design-and-Display-One-big-change" class="headerlink" title="Design and Display: One big change"></a><strong>Design and Display: One big change</strong></h2><p> The Apple Watch SE has the exact same dimensions and design as both the Series 6 and Series 5 before it, with the familiar, mini-iPhone-esque rounded rectangular shape. Whether you opt for the 40mm or 44mm (tested) version, the crisp and compact touchscreen is really the star of the Apple Watch experience, providing a colorful and responsive canvas for watch faces, apps, wellness and fitness tracking, and more.</p><p> The one notable downside is that the Apple Watch SE does not have the always-on display of the Series 5 and 6, which means the screen remains blank when your wrist isn’t raised. Not only is the always-on screen handy for catching a glimpse at the time without waiting a beat for the screen to flicker back to life, but it also helps better sell the idea that it’s a proper timepiece rather than a modern, digital approximation. Still, the first few Apple Watch models didn’t have an always-on screen, and they were still capable, compelling devices.</p><p> The Apple Watch SE does not have the always-on display of the Series 5 and 6, which means the screen remains blank when your wrist isn’t raised.</p><p> Apple offers significantly fewer style options for the Apple Watch SE: just the core Silver, Space Gray, and Gold color options in aluminum. The Series 6 has bold new blue and (Product)RED aluminum colors, along with pricier stainless steel and titanium options, but those are exclusive to the top-line watch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/M6Q1l7xasH7yVvQNIU0Y6IUJ0JU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Apple-Watch-SE-Smart-Watch-6-6cef8c57deb241fa9e95a9917b9f9554.jpg"                      alt="Apple Watch SE"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1300375&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-15_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Still, at least you have the ability to customize the Apple Watch SE with all of the same bands that you can use with any other Apple Watch stretching all the way back to the original, whether you opt for one of Apple’s many official options or a third-party alternative. There are rubber, leather, fabric, and stainless steel options out there, and I’ve personally grown to prefer Apple’s svelte Velcro Sport Loop over the slightly chunkier, ubiquitous rubber Sport Band.</p><p> Functionally, the Apple Watch SE has the same physical controls as the Series 6, with the rotating Digital Crown on the right side above a single button. The Crown is great for scrolling through menus and text, as well as flitting through long lists of options—such as when customizing a watch face with “complications,” or widgets—while the button provides easy access to your current open apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-f9ARHQK-0Eo04PKTZYl13MWOB4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Apple-Watch-SE-Smart-Watch-4-34d5d5f6e67640b1afb12295aed9ca94.jpg"                      alt="Apple Watch SE"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Use-your-iPhone"><a href="#Setup-Process-Use-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Use your iPhone"></a><strong>Setup Process: Use your iPhone</strong></h2><p> You’ll need your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphones-4045605" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to set up the Apple Watch, but it’s a pretty effortless process.

Your iPhone should recognize the nearby Watch, and then you will use the phone’s camera to scan a unique pixel flurry design on the Watch screen to pair the devices. From there, you’ll choose whether to restore from a previous Watch backup or start fresh, as well as log in with your Apple ID and create a Watch passcode. You’ll pick from a few simple setup options along the way, too, but otherwise, it should only take a few minutes.</p><p> The Apple Watch has gradually become a more robust and useful wearable device in time, and the SE model still provides the vast majority of that experience at the lower entry price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Up-to-the-task"><a href="#Performance-Up-to-the-task" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Up to the task"></a><strong>Performance: Up to the task</strong></h2><p> In everyday usage, I found the Apple Watch SE to be smoothly responsive thanks to its dual-core Apple S5 chip, i.e. the same one found in 2019’s Apple Watch Series 5. Apple says that the new S6 chip in the Series 6 is up to 20 percent faster, and put side-by-side, I noticed that apps did indeed load a beat or two faster on the Series 6.

Despite wearing the Watch all day for notifications, light fitness tracking, and wellness-related testing, plus keeping it on overnight for sleep tracking, I was able to get from morning on day one to bedtime on day two without having to top up on the magnetic charging pad.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QAFN7dppliINLwLbznRfOvFzZHo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Apple-Watch-SE-Smart-Watch-2-b1e99514ad654beeb3e851543a9a0390.jpeg"                      alt="Apple Watch SE"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> That’s similar to the performance I recorded with the Apple Watch Series 4 without the sleep tracking, but the Series 6 doesn’t last quite as long.

Both are related to specialized wellness-related sensors that respectively perform electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood oxygen tests. Both help make the Series 6 an appealing consumer wellness wearable for some users, but their omission is surely a big reason why the Apple Watch SE costs 30 percent less than the Series 6.</p><p> The Apple Watch SE doesn’t feel slow on its own, even if it does lag behind the latest and greatest model.</p><p> Even without them, the Apple Watch SE is still a strong wellness and fitness device that can capably track activities like running, biking, and swimming (it’s waterproof), and could encourage movement with its enduringly clever Activity rings. These rings provide an at-a-glance look at your movement, exercise, and how often you’ve gotten up from your seat during the day. They’re social, too, as you can connect with friends and family to potentially help encourage each other to close your rings.</p><p> And although the Apple Watch SE sheds those aforementioned wellness-related sensors, it still reads your heart rate automatically through a sensor pressed against your wrist and claims to alert you if you have an especially high, low, or irregular heart rate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Dk61hNt2QFLLGltR7jKGSOLc4Mw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Apple-Watch-SE-Smart-Watch-7-cd1b0d6bf2d9498ab20849b41d6bfd80.jpg"                      alt="Apple Watch SE"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> It also claims to do little things during the day like prompt you to stand once an hour, to do a breathing exercise, or to wash your hands.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Rexing V1 DashCam is a great choice if you’re in the market for a security-style dashboard camera. Its size and shape are more suited to windshield mounting than other models we tested, plus it captures high-definition footage, decent sound, and is an overall reliable device.</p><p> It has all the additional features you’d expect from a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/types-of-dash-cameras-534889" >dashcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , like loop recording and crash detection, and even some unique ones like timelapse recording. If you’re in the market for a dashcam, the Rexing V1 is definitely worth considering.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JfL4E5NnuBPl6-93Hv3PI4IJsV0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_05-bcfff5f440b545378c9ee4e6b431ffac.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-Fits-perfectly-on-your-windshield"><a href="#Design-Fits-perfectly-on-your-windshield" class="headerlink" title="Design: Fits perfectly on your windshield"></a><strong>Design: Fits perfectly on your windshield</strong></h2><p> The Rexing V1 Dashcam has a more distinctive form factor than other models we reviewed. Unlike many popular dashcam models, the V1 doesn’t resemble a point-and-shoot camera that hangs from your windshield. Rather, it’s angled to fit the curve of the glass. This makes for a more integrated, smooth look.</p><p> And it’s not just looks that make the design appealing. The fact that it’s not a simple square allows easier access to the control panel, improves the viewing angle of the display, and makes navigating the already-simple interface a bit easier.</p><p> There’s only one way to install this camera in your car, and that’s via a mount that sticks to your windshield with an adhesive strip. Fortunately, this works really well and the mount stays in place—throughout our testing, jolts and bumps on the road didn’t budge it. And once the camera was installed on our windshield, it was very easy to slide it on and off the mount.</p><p> Throughout our testing, jolts and bumps on the road didn’t budge it.</p><p> At just 2.7 inches, the display on this dash cam is the smallest among the devices we tested, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. All the icons, menus, and video footage itself are perfectly visible up close. And you probably don’t want to be paying attention to the screen while you’re behind the wheel, anyways—the at-a-glance view of the camera’s status is all you need.</p><p> It also has an internal accelerometer that can detect the impact of an accident, as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-gps-how-it-works-4688647" >GPS capabilities <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with all the necessary equipment to use the GPS feature—if you want to enable these, you have to buy the<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Rexing-GPS-Logger-V1-V1P/dp/B01AKH377A/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4770571%7Cn9eae1cd5706347139b8b83241f9d42ea10%7C" >Rexing GPS Logger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> separately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ztn3EsFqtKkWImvQhtgcr1vlHwI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_02-9ee3aa46e7394a1ab263a6b12b287314.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Be-sure-that’s-where-you-want-to-put-it"><a href="#Setup-Process-Be-sure-that’s-where-you-want-to-put-it" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Be sure that’s where you want to put it"></a><strong>Setup Process: Be sure that’s where you want to put it</strong></h2><p> For those concerned about the hassle of installing a dashcam, don’t worry. The user manual for the Rexing V1 was the clearest and most detailed of all the dashcams we tested. The instructions are written in easy-to-understand language, and every button, feature, and tool is explained in detail so there’s no guesswork when you turn the device on.</p><p> Attaching this dash cam to your windshield is easy. Simply pull the plastic off the double-sided adhesive on the mount and stick it where you want it to go. However, you should be very careful when you’re doing this and make absolutely certain that you want it where you put it the first time. After a few seconds of being attached, it’s on there for good, and it takes a decent amount of ingenuity and elbow grease to get it off. Once it’s off, you can’t reapply it.</p><p> One of the things we appreciated about this dash cam is that it includes a 32GB<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >MicroSD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so you won’t have to put out extra cash to get one. However, there is no microSD card adapter, so if you want to review your footage on a computer you’ll have to buy one of those.</p><p> Also included in the box is a special tool that helps you hide the power cable. To prevent the wire from hanging down in front of your windshield, you need to wedge it up under the edge of the roof and through the side panels (the instruction manual shows you the best route to take). It may seem complicated at first, but this whole process only took us about ten minutes to accomplish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/df0_L-UzAk3OryqSCncsjfqi8QM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_03-2273fff3f71944368711b60f5da9687e.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4742929&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/boxshot(2).png"                      border="0"                >Kanto Player Professional</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4665597&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pcclean.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/winutilities-box-130521.png"                      border="0"                >WinUtilities Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Basic"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Basic" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Basic"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Basic</strong></h2><p> You can set this dash-mounted camera to capture footage in either 720p or 1080p resolution, which is pretty limited. Similar dashcams can capture footage up to 2560 x 1440 resolution, with others going all the way up to 4K. However, if all you’re looking for is a simple security device, 1080p will do just fine.</p><p> When we reviewed the footage captured by the Rexing V1, we found it to be highly detailed and clear when the car was moving along city streets. However, when we hit the freeway, the picture became a little less clear. Signs were hard to read unless you stopped the recording, and small details such as license plates and bumper stickers on other cars couldn’t be made out at all. Nevertheless, the videos yield a good picture of what happens when you drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9_1pHoEq74JWPJ8reothv8PeI8E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_04-c5d42af8ddfa4296a6c6b1e8551edef6.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152810&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/842ca578342915ccb8ae069595ba7233/products/copy_bootit-ss1_178x139.jpg"                      border="0"                >The BootIt Collection covers multi-booting, partitioning, and disk imaging on traditional PC’s using the standard BIOS and  newer PC’s using UEFI.   The collection includes BootIt Bare Metal (BIBM) for standard BIOS systems and BootIt UEFI (BIU) for UEFI system.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BSQL%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/sql-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Set-it-and-forget-it"><a href="#Performance-Set-it-and-forget-it" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Set it and forget it"></a><strong>Performance: Set it and forget it</strong></h2><p> During our testing, we took the Rexing V1 on several lengthy drives through the cities and countryside of northern Utah. In the week that we had it, we never had a problem with how it functioned. It stayed firmly attached to the windshield, powered on every time we turned the ignition and never missed a frame while we were driving. This is one of those devices that embodies the “set it and forget it” mentality.</p><p> This dashcam uses loop recording, which means that it is continuously recording while your car is on, but splices it up into manageable bits rather than one long file. Rexing recommends setting this to three minutes, but you have options to set it to five- and ten-minute intervals as well. When your memory card fills up, the device automatically overwrites the oldest files.</p><p> It stayed firmly attached to the windshield, powered on every time we turned the ignition and never missed a frame while we were driving.</p><p> This dashcam is also equipped with an internal accelerometer that gives it the ability to detect a traffic accident. When it senses that an incident has occurred, it automatically locks the video for that time to prevent it from being overwritten. This is a common feature among the dash cams we tested, but it works well and is a great way to protect yourself if you ever need to prove what happened in an accident.</p><p> One feature that is unique to the Rexing V1 is time-lapse recording. It is turned off by default and Rexing recommends you keep it off for your day-to-day driving. But if you’re taking a road trip with scenic routes or want to record a particular journey, this feature is fun to have.</p><p> Like the rest of the dashboard cameras we tested, the Rexing V1 has the ability to record audio, but it does a middling job of it. Voices in the car and sounds coming from the interior speakers were clear enough to understand, but sounds from outside the vehicle were muddy at best.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/2044747/22993" target="_top" id="2044747"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-2044747"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2044747/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-good-value"><a href="#Price-A-good-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: A good value"></a><strong>Price: A good value</strong></h2><p> The Rexing V1 retails for $130, but as of the time of this writing, can typically be purchased for closer to $100. We feel like this is a perfectly appropriate price for this device—it falls right in the middle of the typical dashcam price range, providing better performance than super budget models, but without the high-tech features of the more expensive options out there. In short, it’s a good price for a solid, basic device.</p><h2 id="Competition-Z3-Plus-vs-Rexing-V1"><a href="#Competition-Z3-Plus-vs-Rexing-V1" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Z3 Plus vs. Rexing V1"></a><strong>Competition: Z3 Plus vs. Rexing V1</strong></h2><p> If you’re wondering if you want to pay the extra $25 or so for the Z-Edge Z3 Plus dashcam (which retails for $125), the decision will come down to form factor and image quality—everything else is pretty much the same.</p><p> The Z3 Plus is square and hangs from your windshield from a suction cup, so it can stick out like a sore thumb. The V1 doesn’t have that problem since it’s angled to fit your windshield, but the adhesive tape that holds it on is one-time-use only. If you make a mistake when installing it, you may end up wishing for the Z3’s clunky suction cup design.</p><p> If the Rexing V1’s 1080p resolution is good enough for you, there’s no need to put down extra cash for more pixels. The video is definitely high-res enough to use as a security device, and can effectively capture an accident or other incident. But if you want great video footage that you’ll enjoy watching in the future, an extra $25 isn’t too high a price to pay.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/z-edge-z3-plus-review-4770582" >Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>It delivers on what it was designed to do, without any extras.</strong></p><p> There isn’t much to complain about with the Rexing V1 DashCam.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The best jump starters blend portability with reliability. Most importantly, it needs to resurrect your car, every time, as quickly as possible (and with minimal hassle). On the other hand, for all the times you’re not in an emergency situation, it needs to tuck neatly away in your car, and not hog a ton of valuable real estate. To find out just how well the DBPOWER 600A Peak 18000mAh Portable Car Jump Starter struck this balance we purposefully drained a car’s battery and got to work testing.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Design-A-rugged-brick-of-power-contained-within-its-own-nice-case"><a href="#Design-A-rugged-brick-of-power-contained-within-its-own-nice-case" class="headerlink" title="Design: A rugged brick of power contained within its own nice case"></a><strong>Design: A rugged brick of power contained within its own nice case</strong></h2><p> The unit and all its accessories are contained within a semi-hard case with a relatively durable zipper holding the two sides of the case together. One side contains the unit itself within a foam insert, and the other is an elastic mesh pouch for all the accessories. The idea here is that you can keep the case stashed in your trunk or under a seat and have everything you need.</p><p> The unit itself is a surprisingly small red and black brick, constructed out of plastic that feels both rugged and yet somehow also soft to the touch. There’s a flashlight on one end of the unit that is mounted flush within the case and on one corner of the case there’s a compass; presumably for the times where you get really lost. All the device’s inputs, outputs, the display, and the on&#x2F;off switch are found on one of the longer sides. No cables stick out from the unit itself, as you must use one of the accessories to enable the device to do any of its actual work.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> The accessory kit contains a wall charger and a 12V port charger for the unit, a DC cable, and a variety of ends to allow for charging a laptop. The jumper cables sprout from a module that plugs into a specific port on the unit and terminate in your standard clamps. The module itself has a status light that illuminates to indicate the unit’s readiness to jump start the car.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-The-cables-are-short-but-easy-to-use"><a href="#Setup-Process-The-cables-are-short-but-easy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: The cables are short but easy to use"></a><strong>Setup Process: The cables are short but easy to use</strong></h2><p> It’s a breeze using the 600A to jump start a car. You plug the jumper cable module into the unit, which will cause its module light to flash green, then connect the red clamp to the positive terminal on your car’s battery and the black clamp to the negative terminal which will cause the module light to illuminate solid green. With our test vehicle it was a little difficult to get the clamps on the negative terminal as they are a little large, and the cables themselves are on the short side. With the clamps in position all that is left is to start the car and remove the clamps in reverse order.</p><p>It’s a breeze using the 600A to jump start a car.</p><p> If it’s other devices that need power, you simply need to turn the unit on and then plug them into the appropriate port. For a laptop, that means you must pick the correct adapter, use the power button to switch the unit to the right power mode for your laptop, and plug it into the DC power port. For a phone or other USB device you pretty much just need to pick one of the two ports and plug in, though the smart port provides better amperage and faster charging.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Immediate-power-to-get-you-back-on-the-road"><a href="#Performance-Immediate-power-to-get-you-back-on-the-road" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Immediate power to get you back on the road"></a><strong>Performance: Immediate power to get you back on the road</strong></h2><p> When it comes to its ability to provide power, the DBPOWER Portable Jump Starter doesn’t disappoint. It reliably started a 2011 Hyundai Elantra that had a battery depleted down to 10V with zero issues, multiple times. With as small as it is, we did have some (thankfully unfounded) concerns that the unit might slide down into the engine bay as soon as the engine started.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> Charging USB devices is not only simple but fast as well, with a sustained 1,200 mAh current. This level of charging will top off your devices in a hurry, and with 18,000 mAh capacity the unit should be able to charge a phone like the Samsung Galaxy S10 five times over. Be aware that if your phone uses a USB-C or Thunderbolt connection you’ll need to provide your own cable.</p><h2 id="Key-Features-A-decent-flashlight-and-oddly-a-compass"><a href="#Key-Features-A-decent-flashlight-and-oddly-a-compass" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: A decent flashlight and, oddly, a compass"></a><strong>Key Features: A decent flashlight and, oddly, a compass</strong></h2><p> Small as it’s, the DBPOWER Portable Jump Starter has a few extra features of note. The flashlight built into the case is decent, but doesn’t put out much light and does so within a relatively narrow angle. However, with as small as the unit is, you can easily just hold the whole thing in your hand like a flashlight to illuminate whatever you need.</p><p>It packs a ton of value into its diminutive size.</p><p> As mentioned before the case does have a compass on it, which is a curious addition to a tool such as this. It’s quite small and is neither illuminated nor does it glow in the dark. We suppose it might be useful to get your bearings in an unfamiliar area, but chances are decent you’re just going to get the car jump started and get back on the road instead.</p><p> Speaking of which, one method of charging the device is through<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >your car’s 12V power port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This means that you can pop the hood on a car with a dead battery, get it jump started, and then use the running car to charge the jump starter as you drive to your next destination.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-low-cost-for-such-a-feature-packed-jump-starter"><a href="#Price-A-low-cost-for-such-a-feature-packed-jump-starter" class="headerlink" title="Price: A low cost for such a feature-packed jump starter"></a><strong>Price: A low cost for such a feature-packed jump starter</strong></h2><p> You can find this model available online for between $70 and $75, and at that price point it packs a ton of value into its diminutive size. There are other units that are a little less expensive, but generally at the expense of some features or included accessories.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1412049&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-200x200.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Splitting-hairs-on-what-features-matter-most-to-you"><a href="#Competition-Splitting-hairs-on-what-features-matter-most-to-you" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Splitting hairs on what features matter most to you"></a><strong>Competition: Splitting hairs on what features matter most to you</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Beatit BT-D11:</em></strong> The two units are so similar in their design and production that it really boils down to one question: How important is charging your laptop to you? If it’s worth the extra $10, stick with the DBPOWER 600A. If not, you can pick up the Beatit BT-D11 for a bit less money and otherwise get a strikingly similar unit.</p><p><strong><em>Aickar Car Jump Starter:</em></strong> Between these two it’s almost too close to call. While the Aickar costs a mere few dollars less, it also has better output current for more reliable jump starts.

Peak 18000mAh Portable Car Jump Starter does everything that it’s designed for quite well, is reliable and durable, and comes in a semi-hard case that you can easily stash in just about any

Keep reading for their full take.</em></p><p> The promise of Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the ultimate RPGs, a game that draws you into a complex, interwoven, living digital world where your decisions truly matter. In the eight years since its development was announced, an immense amount of anticipation has built up around this game, fueled by sky-high promises and too-good-to-be-true teasers. Unfortunately, Cyberpunk 2077, like Spore and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/no-mans-sky-tips-4117336" >No Man’s Sky <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before it, falls short of the hype built up around it.</p><p> Look a little closer, and you may find a lot to love in this game, but it’s important to be aware of Cyberpunk 2077’s many flaws before deciding to jump into the immense and darkly beautiful dystopian metropolis that is Night City.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YQBwL9wFHphVzIqJYlYwd0J2OYU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-2-7e358ac09a2c48fbb0f6aaec1e9381e9.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Story-Engaging-and-well-written"><a href="#Story-Engaging-and-well-written" class="headerlink" title="Story: Engaging and well written"></a>Story: Engaging and well written</h2><p> You start out by choosing from one of several different life paths, each of which features a different intro, as well as unique dialogue options throughout the game. The Nomad starts in the wastelands, the Street Kid in the inner city, and the Corpo in what else but the heart of a mega corporation.</p><p> Once you get past the prologue you are let loose upon Night City, and from here the game progresses through various interconnected missions, both mandatory and optional. Because of this interconnected nature of the game, you may get a different outcome to the overarching story based on your decisions, both in main story missions and side quests. It can be rather daunting to be faced with so many potentially impactful decisions, and between this and the dense skill and ability customization system, this is one instance in which you might want to invest in a physical guide to the game.</p><p> As for the quality of the story itself, whatever path you choose is remarkably well written, and this quality of storytelling is probably the main highlight of the game, next to the insane graphical fidelity. It is well-acted, and some sequences are so well done that you can almost forget you’re playing a game, and it becomes more like an interactive movie. This is in part due to the innovative conversation system, which allows the player more agency while talking to NPCs. Unlike a lot of games, most conversations don’t lock you in and fix you in place until you excuse yourself, and it’s remarkable how natural it feels to talk to people in the game.</p><p> There is clearly a lot more polish put on the main story missions than on some other parts of the game, and if you follow it closely, the flaws of Cyberpunk 2077 don’t show quite so much. You get to experience the massive open world of Night City in a way that makes narrative sense and see the most exciting set-piece sequences. With that said, there are some really entertaining side stories to be found if you venture off the straight and narrow path of the main campaign.</p><p> Cyberpunk’s gameplay is very much a case of sharply contrasting highs and lows.</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Fun-but-deeply-flawed"><a href="#Gameplay-Fun-but-deeply-flawed" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Fun, but deeply flawed"></a>Gameplay: Fun, but deeply flawed</h2><p> As with the game as a whole, Cyberpunk’s gameplay is very much a case of sharply contrasting highs and lows. It does some things very well and stumbles bafflingly in other regards. The game mostly takes place in the first person, with third-person view being an option while driving.</p><p> Driving is not what I’d call a perfect experience in either third or first-person modes. Though beautifully designed and widely varied, vehicles tend to have little weight to them, and you really have to work to avoid careening about the road, running over pedestrians, and attracting the tepid attention of the police. They all also seem to be in desperate need of a new set of brakes, and to make matters worse the AI for the NPC vehicles is very simple indeed. Park your car with a bit of it sticking out into the road and a line will quickly build up as these simpletons exhibit infinite patience rather than simply go around.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NwK7qVv8XDmr_i0b9XzULnmPZ9Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-5-664cae2e38304560a7d6fc3ce2a84335.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1468905&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_728x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> The reason behind the driving issues seems to be largely an issue of perception, as they occur at high speeds, but unless you keep an eye on your speedometer it’s very difficult to judge how fast you’re going. I often found myself going over a hundred, but my mind said I was traveling at half that or less. It would be better for the sake of gameplay if your wheels stuck to the asphalt a bit better, and it wouldn’t really be that unrealistic, given that it is 2077 after all; it makes sense for cars to handle better than they do in 2020.</p><p> What can’t be explained away by an unwise dedication to realism is the behavior of NPCs. This simplicity of NPC AI is widespread throughout the game and a big letdown from what was promised. When I started out, I played very carefully, since the realistic looks and the promise of police response encouraged me to treat everyone with respect, like I was in a real living world. However, as time went on I came to view these automatons with even less consideration than the NPCs in other RPGs.</p><p> Their glitchy reactions are so at odds with their realistic looks that the end result is rather off-putting, so I began to regard them with pure disdain. Also, the fear of police response quickly fades once you realize that they won’t chase you for more than half a block, and once they lose sight of you they forget about you completely in short order. There are no consequences, no exciting spontaneous chase scenes, just a couple of dudes firing at you ineffectually with pistols.</p><p> Furthermore, there are no lasting consequences. Your friendly contact in the NCPD will still call you up and ask for help, and cops on the street won’t care that the world’s most prolific mass murderer just waltzed through the holographic police tape cordoning off their crime scene. By hour 15, the result of this failure of AI systems led to me to think nothing of stealing a car from the middle of a busy intersection and accidentally pinwheeling my out of control vehicle through a crowd of pedestrians before driving off into the sunset as two officers bounced rounds off my retreating bumper.</p><p> If you want to avoid conflict and don’t want to slow down for stupid drivers, your best bet is a motorcycle, and it is indeed a blast to go zipping through the streets dodging through gaps in traffic. For some reason, motorcycles control much more reliably than cars, and a cynical mind might suppose that more care was put into motorcycle control due to Cyberpunk featuring the brand of motorcycle owned by a major celebrity who plays a part in the game’s story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ByBdwophc_bSfdD-P0CfbqJgbwY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-7-e6be7e2c1ae24ac3a1c5dbfd4a5b595a.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> You can also use fast travel booths to get around instantly once you’ve unlocked them, though I found myself favoring the slow route, despite the issues inherent in that experience. Cruising through Night City is truly a jaw-dropping experience.</p><p> This contrast of “holy cow” moments with irritating design flaws continues with combat. In one of the first combat encounters of the game, you fight a dynamic battle in a small apartment that includes walls being ripped apart by gunfire. In another sequence, you fight a crazy cyborg with swords for arms as you race down the freeway. These scripted fights in the story are exciting and well-balanced.</p><p> However, stray from the areas of the world where your story is progressing, and you will meet higher-level enemies. They do more damage and have more strength, and also drop gear that you can’t equip until you level up. This makes sense on a technical level as it prevents the story missions from becoming imbalanced and too easy. The problem is that the enemies look little different from those you’ve fought in lower-level locations, and it really shatters immersion for a random thug with no armor or magic powers to take a dozen sniper rifle bullets to the head to kill. Again, this makes sense from a balancing perspective, but they could have figured out a more dynamic and natural way to scale difficulty throughout the game.</p><p> Other aspects of gameplay include hacking or netrunning as it is referred to in the game. This allows you to take control of various objects and even people, depending on your character build. It’s immensely helpful in tough fights to enter scanning mode, appraise the situation, and use your hacking skills to turn the tide of battle. With hacking, stealth skills, and non-lethal weaponry you can even go for no-kill run, though bugs, glitches, and AI issues may make the temptation to jump in, guns blazing, rather tempting.</p><p> It may sound as though I hated playing Cyberpunk 2077, with as much complaining as I’m doing about gameplay, but the truth is that I had a blast despite the bugs. Driving through Night City is still exciting after dozens of hours, and I’m still finding new weapons that offer new ways to approach combat.</p><p> Driving out of a garage for the first time into a canyon of towering sci-fi skyscrapers bedecked in holograms and neon is one of those awe-inspiring moments that come only fleetingly in video games.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537546&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/7_copy_2_2_hdpro.png"                      border="0"                >HD Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Customization-Lots-to-tinker-with"><a href="#Customization-Lots-to-tinker-with" class="headerlink" title="Customization: Lots to tinker with"></a>Customization: Lots to tinker with</h2><p> There is a deep level of character customization possible in Cyberpunk 2077, and you can sink a lot of time into creating the perfect character. Of course, you can always just pick a preset, but where’s the fun in that? I tried to craft a likeness of Snake Plissken from Escape from Los Angeles, but couldn’t get it quite right, so I made a rough approximation of Basil Fawlty instead.</p><p> Next, you get seven points with which to customize your character’s attributes between body, intelligence, technical ability, and cool. This determines your proficiency in both physical and technical skills. Don’t worry too much, as you will level up and add to these attributes and their associated skills as the game progresses. Skills allow you to fine-tune your abilities, as well as add new ones to your arsenal. It’s a good idea to focus on a specialty, once you know what you enjoy doing in the game because the more points you put into a category the more options unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Uqy4AEm6VMUR3LFH9U2FK5UDvo0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-3-28901c5bd3564eeea8e98bc9dbb8ae07.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> Another area of customization is your cybernetic implants. These can affect everything from your netrunning skills to giving you swords and rocket launchers that pop out of your arms. You’ll need to visit a Ripperdoc to buy and install them, and they cost a pretty penny, so you’ll need to pull off a few jobs to afford them.</p><p> You can also clothe your character in whatever garments you find or buy around the game world. These affect your armor and other stats, though in a somewhat unintuitive fashion where a high-level cotton shirt may give you more armor than a low-level bulletproof vest. This goes for weapons as well, and I ended up going through weapons at a rapid pace as I acquired higher level ones.</p><p> Of course, if you get a weapon you can’t bear to part with you can upgrade it, and you will pick up legendary and epic gear that you will want to hold onto (including clothing). However, I found it to be a bit of a headache figuring out the crafting system, and you need to invest points in the necessary skills to do so.</p><p>At launch, Cyberpunk 2077 is something of a bug-riddled mess.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068416/7443" target="_top" id="2068416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068416"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068416/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bugs-Welcome-to-Glitch-City"><a href="#Bugs-Welcome-to-Glitch-City" class="headerlink" title="Bugs: Welcome to Glitch City"></a>Bugs: Welcome to Glitch City</h2><p> At launch Cyberpunk 2077 is something of a bug-riddled mess. Even a few months and a few patches later it’s very noticeably in need of major fixes. Right out of the gate I found a collectible card that can only be picked up during the intro, but the game refused to allow me to pick it up, so I was forced to leave it sitting there forlornly, forever gnawing at the completionist streak in me.</p><p> It bothered me even though I later found it wasn’t actually unique or important. Just after this, I drove past a dingy alley and glimpsed trash bags flying up into the air from the dumpster. Curious if it was some cyber-raccoon I investigated, but to no avail. It was only silent, motionless bags of trash, quietly minding their own business.</p><p> More game-breaking bugs lay deeper in the game. In one mission I entered a shooting competition, but the mission broke halfway through and locked me in the shooting range. Worse was a bug that rendered me unable to draw my weapons, and this persisted even after loading an earlier save. I ran aimlessly through the streets spamming the alt key until I injured a pedestrian with a car and got a warrant put out for my arrest. When this happened the screen flickered, and suddenly I was clutching an assault rifle. I felt like Ralphie from “A Christmas Story” opening up his Red Rider BB gun.</p><p> Other bugs I ran into included many instances of cars being fused together or spontaneously combusting. One particularly disturbing scene during a mission involved me materializing inside an NPC behind the wheel of a car so that I was staring in horror at the backs of her eyeballs, her detached jaw hanging in mid-air as hair floated like tentacles all about me.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JM3cD1pX6maee1yiQYZnSgc-9pw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-4-624da4fa8225434eb59ba999a53dafd6.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DBanner%2B728x90"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/2e76fe6a-3010-1b37-7846-f34ff9c6b4ca.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Mature-content-Pushing-the-boundaries"><a href="#Mature-content-Pushing-the-boundaries" class="headerlink" title="Mature content: Pushing the boundaries"></a>Mature content: Pushing the boundaries</h2><p> It must be mentioned that Cyberpunk 2077 earns its mature rating. Parents and players alike would do well to head the descriptors of that rating, as all of them are well deserved. There are options to ameliorate this in some respects, but only to a limited extent. The fact is that Cyberpunk 2077 is an imagining of a dark and disturbing future, and the game forces players to confront the consequences should humanity go down such a road.</p><p> The truth is that Cyberpunk is a role-playing game in the truest sense of the word. While you will never be able to completely dodge potentially offensive content, you can play the game in a way that reflects your own morality and ideals. A great example of this potential for choice is alcohol, which you will be proffered on numerous occasions throughout the game. Even though it is embedded into the story you almost always have the option to refuse, though as in real life the peer pressure is there and the choice may affect how people regard you.</p><p> The high quality of storytelling is probably the main highlight of the game, next to the insane graphical fidelity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4742929&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/boxshot(2).png"                      border="0"                >Kanto Player Professional</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Making-strong-GPUs-cry"><a href="#Performance-Making-strong-GPUs-cry" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Making strong GPUs cry"></a>Performance: Making strong GPUs cry</h2><p> Sometimes a game comes along that pushes the limits of what computer hardware is possible. This led to a whole generation of gamers growing up asking the classic question “Can it run Crysis?”. Cyberpunk 2077 is truly the Crysis of the modern day, and that means that at launch very few people will get to experience this game as intended. To get the most out of this game you really need a Nvidia RTX 3080, an expensive GPU that at the time of this writing is so scarce that really only a handful of people around the globe are getting the most out of Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p> With that said, don’t give up hope. PC gamers with last-gen GPUs can still eke out a good experience from this monster of a game. My rig made out pretty well with its RTX 2070, though it took a lot of time tweaking graphics options in order to balance looks with performance.</p><p> Running at 1080p I was able to max out many of the graphics options, though I had to make a few sacrifices. Interestingly, the infamously power-hungry ray tracing tech actually greatly improves performance here if your GPU is capable of it, this is thanks to the integration of DLSS which works with ray tracing to reduce the load on your GPU. You do trade a good deal of sharpness for this DLSS performance boost, but honestly, I find the grainy look to be appropriate for the grimy dystopia depicted in the game.</p><p> Even with my settings well-adjusted I still ran into occasional frame rate drops, particularly in areas with a lot of volumetric fog and many lighting sources. Traveling at high speeds also tested the limits of my gaming rig.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/toUXDFSRFZjol-BOgnhnVEyJTYw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-8-7b54b824c3bc4dcfb04234f69204d2f6.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> If you don’t have a ray tracing enabled card, you may want to think twice about Cyberpunk 2077 until you’re able to upgrade. It’s playable on older cards, but the incredible visuals of this game running on high-end hardware are such an integral part of the experience that it’s hard to recommend running in a reduced capacity. The same goes for last-gen consoles (<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ps4-ps4-slim-and-ps4-pro-4154452" >PS4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-buyers-guide-3562291" >Xbox One <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), where the experience is also greatly impacted by reduced processing power. Players are reporting the worst issues on these older consoles, where Cyberpunk appears to be almost unplayable for many.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >PS5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-review-one-power-packed-4k-console-5088039" >Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may offer a more consistent experience (though not equivalent to high-end PC), but like 30 series Nvidia GPUs these devices are in high demand and short supply, and you won’t be free of bugs, glitches, and performance issues even there.</p><p> An alternative worth considering if you have a robust high-speed internet connection is streaming the game on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-stadia-review-4788032" >Google Stadia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This will allow you to experience the game at its best without having to invest in a two thousand dollar PC. However, it does leave your ability to play the game at the mercy of your ability to access a strong internet connection.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087407/7443" target="_top" id="2087407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087407"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="500"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Ahead-of-its-time"><a href="#Graphics-Ahead-of-its-time" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Ahead of its time"></a>Graphics: Ahead of its time</h2><p> The star of the show in Cyberpunk 2077 are the visuals, and if you have a PC with the hardware to render the game at its maximum quality while maintaining playable frame rates the world of Night City is absolutely jaw-dropping. Driving out of a garage for the first time into a canyon of towering sci-fi skyscrapers bedecked in holograms and neon is one of those awe-inspiring moments that come only fleetingly in video games.</p><p> It may sound as though I hated playing Cyberpunk 2077, with as much complaining as I’m doing about gameplay, but the truth is that I had a blast despite the bugs.</p><p> Everything is so finely detailed, from the lovingly rendered cars to the buildings to the cracked and filthy pavement beneath your feet it is incredible what CDPR has achieved here. Because of how sprawling, spectacular, and densely packed the game is, you can often put aside momentarily the game’s flaws and just admire the sheer scale of it all. Automotive enthusiasts will fall in love with the retro-futuristic design of cars in the game, though unfortunately, car customization is a feature that was pulled before release.</p><p> Character models are also remarkably lifelike, and when conversing with characters in the game it is amazing how little of the nefarious uncanny valley is present in them. However, as previously mentioned, I found that the realistic design of NPCs on the street clashes with their awful AI in a way that brings about an all new but no less awful incarnation of the uncanny valley. This isn’t a critique of the graphics so much as a mark against the buggy and incomplete state of the game.</p><p> One other criticism I have is not a slight against the graphics and is largely a matter of personal preference, but I can’t help but feel somewhat put off by the oppressive dystopian setting after putting many hours into the game. If anything, this is high praise for its realism, as CDPR has managed to realistically depict a dark future that is at times too real for comfort. It’s so grand in its decadent squalor that I can’t help be drawn back in.</p><p> One more thing that irritated me was the repetition of items and advertisements throughout the world. The many glowing holographic and neon advertisements seem to have maybe a dozen or so variations at most and are all rather unpleasant to look at. It’s just a little weird that the developers didn’t design a few more ads given how much unique handcrafted detail is in the rest of the game world.</p><p> Again, it’s important to note that most players won’t see this spectacular vision of Night City due to the demanding hardware requirements, and that is a shame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/o42yZx4igr8SBsJoS2Nc52n6m3U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-6-1b41a87ba1244122adf280147c09e5f1.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4576829&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9e740b84bb48a64dde25061566299467/products/copy_1_jp_box_big.png"                      border="0"                >Jet Profiler for MySQL, Enterprise Version： Jet Profiler for MySQL is real-time query performance and diagnostics tool for the MySQL database server.

However, CDPR has said that a few years down the road they will be launching a multiplayer mode, and a lot of people are looking forward to that. Of course, it is impossible to predict if this will be any good or if some circumstances might prevent its release, but there is a lot of potential for Cyberpunk to become a better experience when Night City goes online. With that said, CDPR really needs to fix the single-player game before they even think about launching multiplayer.</p><h2 id="Price-A-refreshing-lack-of-micro-transactions"><a href="#Price-A-refreshing-lack-of-micro-transactions" class="headerlink" title="Price: A refreshing lack of micro-transactions"></a>Price: A refreshing lack of micro-transactions</h2><p> At $60 with no extra monetization at launch, Cyberpunk 2077 is something of a bargain. Take this with a grain of salt though, as this situation could change dramatically once the multiplayer mode is released.</p><h2 id="Cyberpunk-2077-vs-Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla"><a href="#Cyberpunk-2077-vs-Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla" class="headerlink" title="Cyberpunk 2077 vs. Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla"></a>Cyberpunk 2077 vs. Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</h2><p> Though very different in setting, tone, and gameplay perspective,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/assassin-s-creed-valhalla-review-an-epic-viking-adventure-across-the-medieval-world-5086782" >Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a similarly vast open-world that launched not long before Cyberpunk 2077, and gamers may be split on which to dump a hundred or more hours of time into. At the time of writing, Valhalla is a much more polished and complete experience. Also, whereas the dystopia of Night City can be an oppressive environment to spend many hours exploring, the green hills of England in Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla offer an escapist experience.</p><p> It’s also impossible to avoid comparisons to<a class="link"   href="https://www.liveabout.com/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-cheats-3406136" >Grand Theft Auto <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which in many ways Cyberpunk 2077 bears more than a superficial resemblance to. When you get right down to it, Cyberpunk plays like a heavily modded GTA V with less humor, more bugs, and worse driving mechanics.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/assassin-s-creed-valhalla-review-an-epic-viking-adventure-across-the-medieval-world-5086782" >Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An open-world RPG with enormous potential that’s sadly incomplete and unpolished.</strong></p><p> Cyberpunk 2077 had enormous potential, but it launched long before it was complete and the result is a deeply conflicting experience. Game-breaking bugs, performance issues, missing features, and demanding hardware requirements make it difficult to recommend, but there is the core of something great lying within. There are hundreds of hours of content to enjoy if you can temper your expectations and employ a saintly degree of patience.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink"

However, after a few weeks with this awesome little device, I’m now a firm believer in its merits as both a means towards achieving a healthier lifestyle and as a minimalist smartwatch. It has succeeded in putting me on the path towards meaningful weight loss where countless diets and New Years’ resolutions have failed.</p><h2 id="Design-Minimalist-masterpiece"><a href="#Design-Minimalist-masterpiece" class="headerlink" title="Design: Minimalist masterpiece"></a><strong>Design: Minimalist masterpiece</strong></h2><p> The Fitbit Charge 4 is sleek and stylish with a futuristic flare. The patterned strap is attractive and catches the light in interesting ways. The square screen is practical, but may not appeal to folks who prefer round watches. It feels pretty durable, and it’s waterproof down to 50 meters. After a number of rigorous outdoor adventures, it’s come through unscathed. The Charge 4 comes with a charging station and both small and large wristbands. It’s easy to swap the wrist bands out, and Fitbit sells a variety of alternative styles.</p><p> It has succeeded in putting me on the path towards meaningful weight loss where countless diets and New Years’ resolutions have failed.</p><p> A quick press of the button on the side of the watch takes you back to the clock face or turns it on if it fails to show up automatically when you move your wrist (which does happen, albeit infrequently). Hold the button down and you get access to do not disturb, sleep mode, and other functions, as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-fitbit-pay-4582307" >Fitbit Pay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hXje3GJQ1qjDfhBph7Q2s-LKCTE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fitbit-Charge-4-Fitness-Tracker-4-5fb3fda3d53d4120bfb7c3e1b418abab.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Charge 4"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-process-Streamlined-and-straightforward"><a href="#Setup-process-Streamlined-and-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Setup process: Streamlined and straightforward"></a><strong>Setup process: Streamlined and straightforward</strong></h2><p> My<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review-4683995" >Samsung Galaxy Note 9 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> immediately noticed that the Charge 4 was nearby when I powered the smartwatch up, and a tap of the screen of my phone took me to the download page for the app. Once installed, the app guided me through the setup process. You’ve got to enter a bunch of information about yourself, including name, birth date, weight, and gender. Next, the app shows a helpful animation of how to attach the charger. I like the smiley face the device gives you when it starts charging; it’s a small touch, but it gives the Charge 4 a little jolt of personality.</p><p> After this, it was time to actually pair the Charge 4 to my phone, and after an annoying Squaretrade “Fitbit protection plan” ad, I needed to install an update. While that was downloading I was given a list of first-time user guides. This was useful, with plenty of information about how to use the device, though I would have preferred a printed manual. After the device is up to date, a further set of animated guides showed me the various controls and gestures used to navigate the Charge 4. Finally, the app had a few product care tips and another annoying ad (this time for a Fitbit Premium account) and was ready to go.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-A-good-fit"><a href="#Comfort-A-good-fit" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: A good fit"></a><strong>Comfort: A good fit</strong></h2><p> As someone with ridiculously large wrists, I really appreciated that the Charge 4 comes with a larger watch band. It was easy to switch out the band by depressing a recessed button on the underside of the watch, and between the two included bands, the Charge 4 should fit just about anyone. I was surprised by just how comfortable this smartwatch was for me; the larger band has plenty of room to spare even on my wrists.</p><p> As someone with ridiculously large wrists, I really appreciated that the Charge 4 comes with a larger watch band.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713321&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVDJ1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV DJ Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-A-digital-fitness-coach"><a href="#Performance-A-digital-fitness-coach" class="headerlink" title="Performance: A digital fitness coach"></a><strong>Performance: A digital fitness coach</strong></h2><p> No fitness tracker is 100% accurate, and the Charge 4 is no exception, but that’s not as much of a problem as you might assume. Though everything from step counts to elevation change to calories expended and consumed has margins for error, they nonetheless give you goals to work towards, and this rough data is perfectly adequate to help you become more conscious of your physical health.</p><p> Despite small variances in reporting vs. the actual number of steps I was taking or calories I was consuming, this device made me more aware of how much exercise I was getting and how much I was eating. This encouraged me to get more exercise and eat healthier. Also, it’s worth noting that the Charge 4 tracks so many different stats that the cumulative data from such a large variety of factors helps to iron out irregularities from any given reading.</p><p> Sleep tracking is a cool feature, and it seemed to have a pretty good idea of when I was asleep and when I was awake, though sometimes it would fail to record detailed statistics for no discernable reason. Heart Rate tracking isn’t bad either, though my impression is that it was estimating my heart rate somewhat high.</p><p> Calorie tracking was most useful to me, as it gave me a rough estimate to compare to my caloric intake. By entering every meal I ate into the app, I got an idea of how much I could eat during the day and how much exercise I needed to get. Because of this I have been going for more walks and eating healthier. I have almost entirely cut snacks out of my day, and I find myself doing circles around the driveway or going up and down flights of stairs in order to be able to have a little dessert after dinner.</p><p> I didn’t find personalized exercise reminders, the workout intensity map, or exercise tracking to be particularly helpful, but that’s very much a matter of personal preference. In terms of navigation and functionality, the Charge 4 functions very well without much in the way of lag, and the interface is easy to navigate. The only problem comes when you get below 20% battery. A power-saving mode kicks in at that point and the functionality of the watch drops significantly. You’ll want to charge it before it gets to this point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UlCfm0YzhPSZMR3WWRs3oeCWPsA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fitbit-Charge-4-Fitness-Tracker-2-6afa07ba83e74effb1bd3521b2b43391-3287de2174dc42359f46f06e6576d80b.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Charge 4"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Software-Intuitive-but-ad-infested"><a href="#Software-Intuitive-but-ad-infested" class="headerlink" title="Software: Intuitive but ad infested"></a><strong>Software: Intuitive but ad infested</strong></h2><p> Both the interface of the watch and the companion app for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ios-1994355" >IOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-android-1616887" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> function nearly flawlessly. Menus are easy to navigate, and data is both in-depth while also being easy to access and analyze. Though the hardware itself is a marvel of design and miniaturization, the software is where the magic happens. The Charge 4 essentially turns weight loss and healthy living into a game, and for me, this is an addictive and rewarding game indeed.</p><p> One thing to consider is that some features such as sleep score details and custom challenges are locked behind a steep paywall that will run you $10 a month or $80 per year. It’s pretty easy to set up a subscription like this, never use it, and forget to cancel it until years later when you’ve spent a hefty chunk of change on the service. Annoyingly, the ad for this premium service is permanently affixed to the toolbar in the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wFO4EEqsgPPy2Dq-eUgUTZ1q70A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fitbit-Charge-4-Fitness-Tracker-3-38e2a0e1ea5a46ee85939b8dec6d6a48.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Charge 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4742929&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/boxshot(2).png"                      border="0"                >Kanto Player Professional</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Battery-Life-Awesome-but-with-caveats"><a href="#Battery-Life-Awesome-but-with-caveats" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life: Awesome, but with caveats"></a><strong>Battery Life: Awesome, but with caveats</strong></h2><p> The Charge 4 lasts about six days on a charge under typical use, which is better than most advanced smartwatches. It charges quickly and most of the time isn’t something you have to worry about.</p><p> However, I did run into a few issues worth mentioning. First of all, when the battery drops below 20% the Charge 4 seems to go into a power-saving mode that limits functionality. Secondly, using features like exercise tracking that use the GPS will drain the battery much more quickly. When I embarked with a full charge on a two-day backpacking trip and set the Charge 4 to record the hike as an exercise it only lasted me through roughly 75% of the two days of trekking.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Good-value"><a href="#Price-Good-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: Good value"></a><strong>Price: Good value</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $150 the Fitbit Charge 4 is somewhat expensive but fairly priced for a basic smartwatch. However, extra accessories and subscription services can quickly add to the cost.</p><h2 id="Fitbit-Charge-4-vs-Fossil-Sport"><a href="#Fitbit-Charge-4-vs-Fossil-Sport" class="headerlink" title="Fitbit Charge 4 vs. Fossil Sport"></a><strong>Fitbit Charge 4 vs. Fossil Sport</strong></h2><p> For a more fully-featured smartwatch with a more classic watch design, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fossil-sport-review-5069585" >Fossil Sport <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an attractive alternative to the Fitbit Charge 4.

However, the Charge 4 has the benefit of simplicity that lends a much more intuitive experience.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Whether you’re looking for a minimalist smartwatch or an effective fitness tracker, the Fitbit Charge 4 is a generally excellent device.</strong></p><p> I was frankly shocked by how much I have come to like the Fitbit Charge 4. It’s as functional as it’s good looking, and provides both reasonably accurate fitness tracking and well integrated basic smartwatch functionality. Despite a few minor flaws such as a subscription paywall for some features and battery hogging GPS I can heartily recommend the Charge 4.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink"

Read on for our full take.</em></p><p> Nvidia’s RTX 30 series is the hottest thing in PC gaming right now. So hot, in fact, that it’s almost impossible to buy a desktop RTX 30 series graphics card, and even laptops with the hardware are flying off store shelves.</p><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is, in many respects, a mid-range gaming laptop, but it succeeds at one very important task: it delivers Nvidia RTX 3060 Max-Q at a reasonable price, and it’s actually in stock not just at, but sometimes below, MSRP. Its value pricing helps the Triton 300 SE stand out against attractive competitors like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14.</p><h2 id="Design-Small-but-sturdy"><a href="#Design-Small-but-sturdy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Small but sturdy"></a>Design: Small but sturdy</h2><p> I’m surprised Acer didn’t slap a “Pro” label on the Predator Triton 300 SE. The spec sheet might scream gaming, but the laptop’s look and feel has more in common with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >business laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The aluminum exterior and simple silver interior keep this laptop subtle. It’s a bit dull, actually, compared to the sleek elegance of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-book-13-review-5176895" >Razer’s Book 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the brash look of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The Triton 300 SE measures 0.7 inches thick and weighs a hair less than 3.5 pounds. These figures aren’t unusual in 2021 but are impressive for a laptop packing serious gaming horsepower. It will easily fit in most backpacks or messenger bags, yet packs performance to rival modern game consoles.</p><p> It’s a sturdy little beast, too. The chassis feels slate-like in hand. Holding the laptop up by one corner reveals nearly no flex. The display is the weak point; opening the laptops can cause a few creaks and groans.</p><p> Physical connectivity is a mix of new and old. There are two USB-A 3.2 ports paired with a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port that supports DisplayPort Mode and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-thunderbolt-832713" >Thunderbolt 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There’s also an HDMI output and a 3.5mm audio jack that handles audio-in and out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RkOepytb4JglYF6g8lqap4lR4Uk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-5-b8c978f2d42a4865be1ea11a4785c104.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> All the laptop’s ports are placed near the front of the chassis. You’ll have to deal with tangled cables more often than with a laptop that places most ports on the rear. I found this annoying when using an external mouse, as cables jutting from the laptop’s flanks often bumped my hand while playing games.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097466/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097466"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097466"                      border="0" alt="" width="2048" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097466/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What’s-New-This-one-is-special"><a href="#What’s-New-This-one-is-special" class="headerlink" title="What’s New: This one is special"></a>What’s New: This one is special</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE has little in common with other Predator Triton or Helios models.

Smith</p><p> There’s one downside: poor viewing angles. This is unusual in a modern laptop, though I’ve noticed this trait in many high-refresh laptop displays. I can’t give the Triton 300 SE too much flak for this given its otherwise excellent performance.</p><h2 id="Performance-Great-for-games-ok-for-everything-else"><a href="#Performance-Great-for-games-ok-for-everything-else" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Great for games, ok for everything else"></a>Performance: Great for games, ok for everything else</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s most unusual feature is its Intel Core i7-11375H processor. It’s odd because it has just four cores (running eight threads) but is still sold as a top-tier component. The Core i7-11375H has higher minimum and maximum clock speeds than the comparable Intel Core i7-1165G7 found in thinner notebooks. The i7-11375H can clock as high as 5GHz. My review unit also had 16GB of RAM and a 512GB solid-state hard drive.</p><p> PCMark 10 hit an overall score of 5,534. Geekbench 5 turned in a single-core score of 1,418 and a multi-core score of 4,493. The Geekbench 5 multi-core score is behind the curve;<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amd-vs-intel-which-processor-is-best-for-you-4780276" >new AMD Ryzen 7 5000-series laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can almost double that result. This will disappoint content creators who use CPU-dependent applications. The Acer Triton 300 SE won’t keep up with AMD-powered rivals, like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, in such workloads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_blPSVdy574t15clSGhbK6JH68o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-4-5a097b76e29b4ee985eee421ed6d0fe8.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> Gaming performance proved more impressive. 3DMark Fire Strike hit a score of 14,462, while Time Spy hit a score of 6,721. The laptop averaged 143 FPS in the GFXBench Car Chase test. It also averaged 74 frames per second in Shadow of the Tomb Raider at high detail with ray-traced shadows off.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ray-tracing-5097484" >Turning ray-traced shadows on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> reduced the average to 56 frames per second.</p><p> For me, the Triton 300 SE is easily fast enough: it can handle most games at an average of 60 frames per second (fps), and often much higher, at 1080p resolution.</p><p> These numbers may seem disappointing if compared to all RTX 3060 laptops. You can expect more from Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 and the Razer Blade 15. But don’t forget the price. Acer’s laptop significantly undercuts those alternatives. When compared to all gaming laptops, this Acer delivers great performance for the price.</p><p> For me, the Triton 300 SE is easily fast enough: it can handle most games at an average of 60 frames per second (fps), and often much higher, at 1080p resolution. I wouldn’t recommend the Triton 300 SE if you plan to use an external 1440p or 4K monitor, however. Pushing a higher pixel count will lead to sub-60fps performance in most demanding games.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/c/5597632/1988416/23719" target="_top" id="1988416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23719-1988416"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1988416/23719"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Productivity-All-business"><a href="#Productivity-All-business" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: All business"></a>Productivity: All business</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s business-like design carries over to the keyboard and mouse.

The Control, Function, and Windows keys are noticeable examples.

I created a real-world stress test by downloading Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam while simultaneously downloading Metro Exodus on Epic. Surprisingly, both downloads averaged in excess of 25Mbps. I’m used to seeing numbers in the teens.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-BYOW-Bring-Your-Own-Webcam"><a href="#Camera-BYOW-Bring-Your-Own-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="Camera: BYOW (Bring Your Own Webcam)"></a>Camera: BYOW (Bring Your Own Webcam)</h2><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE straddles the line between entertainment and productivity in its design, but the camera falls short of its professional aspirations. It’s a tiny 720p pinhole camera that squeezes between the display and the top bezel. Video quality is grainy in all but the brightest rooms and uneven lighting can easily confuse it.</p><h2 id="Battery-Ouch"><a href="#Battery-Ouch" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Ouch"></a>Battery: Ouch</h2><p> It’s easy to pack the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE in a bag for travel, but keeping it charged is a different story. This is a powerful laptop yet, due to its size, it contains a modest 60 watt-hour battery. That would be fine in a laptop without discrete graphics, but this is a gaming laptop.</p><p> I didn’t expect much endurance and received even less. My first effort at using the Triton 300 SE for a workday of writing had me reaching for the power brick after 3 hours. Two further workdays put me at about 3 hours, 30 minutes each.</p><p> It’s easy to pack the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE in a bag for travel, but keeping it charged is a different story.</p><p> In fairness to Acer, there’s little it could do to fix this issue. A slim gaming laptop sucks down a lot of juice even outside of games, yet there’s not much room for a battery. The majority of gaming laptops I’ve tested in recent years have delivered less than 4 hours of real-world endurance, and the worst won’t last 2 hours.</p><p> Still, buyer beware. The Triton 300 SE might look like a productivity laptop, but its battery life is solidly in the realm of full-blown gaming machines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RSfl2dEVmErlvh3BUUFcxqsbt9w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-2-c5eed4bfe7e44014952b5503566097d9.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1922358/21553" target="_top" id="1922358"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1922358"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1922358/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><h2 id="Software-Planet-what-now"><a href="#Software-Planet-what-now" class="headerlink" title="Software: Planet what now?"></a>Software: Planet what now?</h2><p> Acer ships the Predator Triton 300 SE with Windows 10 Home. It includes a few touches exclusive to Acer, including a Planet9 wallpaper and a few other icons under the same.</p><p> Despite this, most laptop functions are controlled through the PredatorSense software interface. It can control fan modes, adjust keyboard lighting, and monitor temperatures, among other functions. PredatorSense is not much to look at, but I find it less confusing than the alternatives from Asus and Razer.</p><p> The laptop comes with Norton antivirus installed. It’s eager to remind you of its presence whenever you download a file or visit an unfamiliar website. The antivirus is easy to uninstall, but its presence takes away from what otherwise feels like a special laptop in Acer’s Predator line.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-An-outstanding-value"><a href="#Price-An-outstanding-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: An outstanding value"></a>Price: An outstanding value</h2><p> Acer sells the Predator Triton 300 SE for $1,400, and it sometimes sells for $1,350 at Best Buy. This is an outstanding price for a laptop packing Nvidia’s RTX 3060. There’s only a few competitors with the RTX 3060, such as MSI’s GF65 Thin, that can be purchased for less right now. The MSI GF65 manages to undercut the Triton 300 SE by using an older Intel chip and just 8GB of RAM.</p><h2 id="Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-vs-Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G14"><a href="#Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-vs-Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G14" class="headerlink" title="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14"></a>Acer Predator Triton 300 SE vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</h2><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE and Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 seem to target the same users. They’re both compact, light 14-inch laptops that pack impressive CPU and GPU horsepower. Although great for gamers, they also appeal to content creators seeking an affordable, portable laptop.</p><p> The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 wins out in design and build quality. It’s an attractive, eye-catching laptop that feels more solid than the already respectable Triton 300 SE. The two laptops trade blows in display, keyboard, touchpad, and connectivity, with neither having a significant edge.</p><p> Game performance is similar, but the Asus G14 embraces AMD processors with up to eight cores. A well-equipped G14 will easily trounce the Acer in multi-core processor tests. Game performance is roughly similar when both are configured with an RTX 3060 graphics chip, with the Asus G14 having a slight edge.</p><p> While the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a better laptop overall, price is a factor. The Asus G14 is sold for $1,500 when configured with Nvidia’s RTX 3060 and is harder to find in stock. Paying a bit more for the Asus G14 makes sense to content creators who need its superior processor performance, but gamers could find more value in Acer’s alternative.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus Zephyrus G14 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Excellent value for an RTX-powered gaming laptop.</strong></p><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is an excellent value that has what gamers want: a great gaming experience and a quality display. Its short battery life and mediocre multi-core processor hold it back in everyday use, but the laptop’s competitive price makes these flaws easy to forgive.</p><h3

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Does-PokeGo-still-work-on-Apple-iPhone-14-iPad"><a href="#Does-PokeGo-still-work-on-Apple-iPhone-14-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 14&#x2F;iPad?"></a>Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 14&#x2F;iPad?</h2><p>Pokemon Go players always look forward to cheats and hacks that can help them catch more Pokemon in the game. While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.</p><p>One such cheat&#x2F;hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pokego"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pokego" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Pokego++?"></a>Part 1: What is Pokego++?</h2><p>If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 14&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 14 or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon. So, if PokeGo++ doesn’t work anymore, what’s an alternative that can help you use a fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.</p><p>The answer is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a dedicated geo-spoofing tool for iOS that comes with a built-in “Teleport Mode” feature. Thanks to this feature, you can change your smartphone’s location to anywhere in the world with a single click.</p><p>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also comes with a dedicated GPS Joystick. This means apart from changing your smartphone’s location, you can also fake your movement on the map and virtually collect different Pokemon. One of the best features of Virtual Location is that it lets you customize your movement speed. So, even if you are faking your location in the game, you can stay assured that Niantic won’t ban your account.</p><p>Here are a few key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) that makes it the best geo spoofing tool to fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.</p><ul><li>Use Teleport Mode to Choose Any Location Across the Globe</li><li>Use GPS Joystick to virtually collect all your favorite Pokemon GO characters</li><li>Customize the movement speed using a simple slider</li><li>Automatic marching to configure your character to move in one direction automatically</li><li>Control GPS location for up to 5 iOS devices simultaneously</li><li>Compatible with the latest iOS version</li></ul><p>So, if you are also ready to use the best PokeGo++ alternative, here’s the detailed step-by-step process to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>That’s it; when you’ll launch Pokemon Go, you’ll automatically notice different streets. At this point, you can enable “GPS Joystick” and easily control your movement without walking at all.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.absolute.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4601998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ef70e26a0b5da778eda3f48014d087cd/728x90_larger-shield.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Despite being a pretty useful tweaked version of Pokemon Go, PokeGO++ is not available anymore.

Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone 14 or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.</p><p>When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 14 device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.</p><p>All we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to <strong>change location on Apple iPhone 14</strong>, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?"></a>Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?</h2><p>Step 1: On your Apple iPhone 14, go to the App Store app.</p><p>Step 2: Click on the “Featured” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/featured-tab-app-store.jpg"                      alt="featured tab app store"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, scroll down to locate your Apple id and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/locate-apple-id-app-store.jpg"                      alt="locate apple id app store"                ></p><p>Step 4: Choose “View Apple ID”.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Does-PokeGo-still-work-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-iPad"><a href="#Does-PokeGo-still-work-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 14 Pro&#x2F;iPad?"></a>Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 14 Pro&#x2F;iPad?</h2><p>Pokemon Go players always look forward to cheats and hacks that can help them catch more Pokemon in the game. While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.</p><p>One such cheat&#x2F;hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pokego"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pokego" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Pokego++?"></a>Part 1: What is Pokego++?</h2><p>If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 14 Pro&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 14 Pro or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon. So, if PokeGo++ doesn’t work anymore, what’s an alternative that can help you use a fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.</p><p>The answer is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a dedicated geo-spoofing tool for iOS that comes with a built-in “Teleport Mode” feature. Thanks to this feature, you can change your smartphone’s location to anywhere in the world with a single click.</p><p>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also comes with a dedicated GPS Joystick.

One of the best features of Virtual Location is that it lets you customize your movement speed. So, even if you are faking your location in the game, you can stay assured that Niantic won’t ban your account.</p><p>Here are a few key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) that makes it the best geo spoofing tool to fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.</p><ul><li>Use Teleport Mode to Choose Any Location Across the Globe</li><li>Use GPS Joystick to virtually collect all your favorite Pokemon GO characters</li><li>Customize the movement speed using a simple slider</li><li>Automatic marching to configure your character to move in one direction automatically</li><li>Control GPS location for up to 5 iOS devices simultaneously</li><li>Compatible with the latest iOS version</li></ul><p>So, if you are also ready to use the best PokeGo++ alternative, here’s the detailed step-by-step process to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>That’s it; when you’ll launch Pokemon Go, you’ll automatically notice different streets.

However, if you still want to catch different types of Pokemon in the game, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (iOS) to set a fake GPS location in the game.

Don’t worry, there are plenty of ways to view GPX online or offline. In this post, I will let you know how to view GPX in Google Maps and other resourceful desktop applications in detail.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921"                      border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files"><a href="#Part-1-What-Can-you-Do-with-GPX-Files" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?"></a>Part 1: What Can you Do with GPX Files?</h2><p>Before we discuss how to utilize a GPX view online or offline tool, let’s quickly consider how these files work. It stands for GPS Exchange format and stores map-related data in an XML format. Apart from XML, KML and KMZ are other common file formats to store GPX data.</p><p>From the exact coordinates of places to their routes, a GPX file would contain the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>Coordinates</strong>: Also know as waypoints, a GPX file would contain details about longitude and latitude that are needed to be covered on the map.</li><li><strong>Routes</strong>: The main reason for using GPX files is that they store detailed routing information (the path that we need to take to reach from one point to another).</li><li><strong>Tracks</strong>: A track consists of various points that we are merged to form the route or the path.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/view-gpx-files-online-2.jpg"                      alt="GPX File"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2069351&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-24_%282%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Let’s suppose you have devised a route between two points that you would need later on. You can now export the GPX file from the application and even import it to the same or another application. When you use the GPX viewer, it will let you access the route offline without an active internet connection. That’s why GPX files are used to view a route offline while hiking, trekking, cycling, and do other offline activities.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-View-GPX-Files-Online-in-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?"></a>Part 2: How to View GPX Files Online in Google Maps?</h2><p>The good thing is that there are tons of options to view GPX online on desktop, Android, or iOS platforms.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Does-PokeGo-still-work-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-iPad"><a href="#Does-PokeGo-still-work-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max&#x2F;iPad?"></a>Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max&#x2F;iPad?</h2><p>Pokemon Go players always look forward to cheats and hacks that can help them catch more Pokemon in the game. While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.</p><p>One such cheat&#x2F;hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pokego"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pokego" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Pokego++?"></a>Part 1: What is Pokego++?</h2><p>If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon. So, if PokeGo++ doesn’t work anymore, what’s an alternative that can help you use a fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.</p><p>The answer is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a dedicated geo-spoofing tool for iOS that comes with a built-in “Teleport Mode” feature. Thanks to this feature, you can change your smartphone’s location to anywhere in the world with a single click.</p><p>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also comes with a dedicated GPS Joystick. This means apart from changing your smartphone’s location, you can also fake your movement on the map and virtually collect different Pokemon. One of the best features of Virtual Location is that it lets you customize your movement speed. So, even if you are faking your location in the game, you can stay assured that Niantic won’t ban your account.</p><p>Here are a few key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) that makes it the best geo spoofing tool to fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.</p><ul><li>Use Teleport Mode to Choose Any Location Across the Globe</li><li>Use GPS Joystick to virtually collect all your favorite Pokemon GO characters</li><li>Customize the movement speed using a simple slider</li><li>Automatic marching to configure your character to move in one direction automatically</li><li>Control GPS location for up to 5 iOS devices simultaneously</li><li>Compatible with the latest iOS version</li></ul><p>So, if you are also ready to use the best PokeGo++ alternative, here’s the detailed step-by-step process to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>That’s it; when you’ll launch Pokemon Go, you’ll automatically notice different streets.

While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.</p><p>One such cheat&#x2F;hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pokego"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pokego" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Pokego++?"></a>Part 1: What is Pokego++?</h2><p>If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 14 Plus&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087394/7443" target="_top" id="2087394"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087394"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 14 Plus or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033101&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Elite.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon.

You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 13&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 13 or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.dbschema.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19867419&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/176b22bab4e94a28619ca2433b2ef241/products/1_icon256.png"                      border="0"                ><br>DbSchema database designer for all databases, schema design in the team, schema deployment, interactive diagrams, documentation, data and query tools. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Does-PokeGo-still-work-on-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-iPad"><a href="#Does-PokeGo-still-work-on-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 13 Pro&#x2F;iPad?"></a>Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 13 Pro&#x2F;iPad?</h2><p>Pokemon Go players always look forward to cheats and hacks that can help them catch more Pokemon in the game. While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.</p><p>One such cheat&#x2F;hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pokego"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pokego" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Pokego++?"></a>Part 1: What is Pokego++?</h2><p>If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 13 Pro&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BSQL%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/sql-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 13 Pro or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Does-PokeGo-still-work-on-Apple-iPhone-13-mini-iPad"><a href="#Does-PokeGo-still-work-on-Apple-iPhone-13-mini-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 13 mini&#x2F;iPad?"></a>Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 13 mini&#x2F;iPad?</h2><p>Pokemon Go players always look forward to cheats and hacks that can help them catch more Pokemon in the game. While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.</p><p>One such cheat&#x2F;hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pokego"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pokego" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Pokego++?"></a>Part 1: What is Pokego++?</h2><p>If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 13 mini&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 13 mini or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38709260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (2-PC)  Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon. So, if PokeGo++ doesn’t work anymore, what’s an alternative that can help you use a fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.</p><p>The answer is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

At this point, you can enable “GPS Joystick” and easily control your movement without walking at all.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Despite being a pretty useful tweaked version of Pokemon Go, PokeGO++ is not available anymore.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Does-PokeGo-still-work-on-Apple-iPhone-12-iPad"><a href="#Does-PokeGo-still-work-on-Apple-iPhone-12-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 12&#x2F;iPad?"></a>Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 12&#x2F;iPad?</h2><p>Pokemon Go players always look forward to cheats and hacks that can help them catch more Pokemon in the game. While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.</p><p>One such cheat&#x2F;hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pokego"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pokego" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Pokego++?"></a>Part 1: What is Pokego++?</h2><p>If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 12&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well.

Apple iPhone 12 Pro&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657397/16446" target="_top" id="1657397"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657397"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657397/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 12 Pro or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon.

Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone 12 Pro or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.</p><p>When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.</p><p>All we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to <strong>change location on Apple iPhone 12 Pro</strong>, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?"></a>Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?</h2><p>Step 1: On your Apple iPhone 12 Pro, go to the App Store app.</p><p>Step 2: Click on the “Featured” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/featured-tab-app-store.jpg"                      alt="featured tab app store"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048963/16384" target="_top" id="2048963"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048963"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048963/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 3: Now, scroll down to locate your Apple id and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/locate-apple-id-app-store.jpg"                      alt="locate apple id app store"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22889392&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://webstatic.nero.com/nero2015-com-wAssets/img/affiliate/media/banner728-90eng.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 4: Choose “View Apple ID”.

How do I <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-location/how-to-change-weather-location-ipad.html" >change weather location on Apple iPhone 12 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</strong></p><p>If you have changed your location or the app misperceives your location, follow these steps and get accurate weather updates:</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Go to your iDevice’s weather widget and long-press to choose the “Edit Weather” option. Now, tap “My Location” to check your current location. If it’s wrong and you want to change it, type and select the exact one in the “Search” bar. This way, your weather location will be changed on the weather app on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro.</p><p><strong>2. Will changing my location affect my device’s warranty or performance?</strong></p><p>The device’s warranty generally depends on the product and has nothing to do with moving locations. Yet it’s advisable to check the terms and conditions of the warranty. You can check if those conditions cover your device regardless of location. In short, changing location will not affect your phone, but you should note its local regulations.</p><p><strong>3. Is there a risk of my account being banned in certain apps or games if I change my location?</strong></p><p>Yes, you might encounter issues in certain apps if you change location on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro. This is because some apps have terms that prohibit falsifying locations. If they observe a rapid change in location due to VPN, it could lead to a ban to maintain fair play. To avoid this issue, always use a legitimate means of updating locations and be familiar with other terms.</p><p><strong>4. How do I change my location back to my real one?</strong></p><p>If you have faked your location on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro for certain games and applications, check the settings of your location spoofer. Within the app settings, you can revert to your actual location. Apart from that, if you are using a VPN to change location, disconnect from it. Upon turning it off, your device will return to the real location.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>In this guide, you have learned how to <strong>change location on the Apple iPhone 12 Pro</strong> in different scenarios.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Does-PokeGo-still-work-on-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Max-iPad"><a href="#Does-PokeGo-still-work-on-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Max-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max&#x2F;iPad?"></a>Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max&#x2F;iPad?</h2><p>Pokemon Go players always look forward to cheats and hacks that can help them catch more Pokemon in the game. While the majority of cheats available on the Internet no longer work, there are a few tricks that might help you expand your collection with unique Pokemon characters.</p><p>One such cheat&#x2F;hack, that has helped many iOS users collect Pokemon in the past, is PokeGo++. If you’ve been planning to use PokeGo++ to catch rare Pokemon, continue reading; this guide will provide you a deep insight into PokeGo++ and whether you can use it in 2021 or not.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pokego"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pokego" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Pokego++?"></a>Part 1: What is Pokego++?</h2><p>If you’re new to the Pokemon Go world and haven’t heard about PokeGo++, here’s what you need to know. It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS. For users who don’t know, Cydia Impactor is a dedicated iOS tool that lets users install and run sideload apps on the iDevice without having to jailbreak it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-get-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++"></a>Part 2: Where Can I get PokeGo ++</h2><p>So, let’s get to the real question, i.e., does PokeGo++ still work. Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well. In fact, Niantic even secured all their future projects with this lawsuit. It was believed that Global++ was secretly working on a hacked version of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Niantic’s next big project. But, due to the lawsuit, they had to stop working on this as well. So, as shocking as it may sound, but you can no longer use PokeGo++ Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max or Android to fake GPS location and catch new Pokemon.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo"><a href="#Part-3-Any-better-alternative-for-PokeGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++"></a>Part 3: Any better alternative for PokeGo ++</h2><p>Even though PokeGo++ is no longer available, people still look forward to using other hacks&#x2F;tricks to manipulate their GPS location to collect more Pokemon. So, if PokeGo++ doesn’t work anymore, what’s an alternative that can help you use a fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.</p><p>The answer is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a dedicated geo-spoofing tool for iOS that comes with a built-in “Teleport Mode” feature. Thanks to this feature, you can change your smartphone’s location to anywhere in the world with a single click.</p><p>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also comes with a dedicated GPS Joystick. This means apart from changing your smartphone’s location, you can also fake your movement on the map and virtually collect different Pokemon. One of the best features of Virtual Location is that it lets you customize your movement speed. So, even if you are faking your location in the game, you can stay assured that Niantic won’t ban your account.</p><p>Here are a few key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) that makes it the best geo spoofing tool to fake GPS location in Pokemon Go.</p><ul><li>Use Teleport Mode to Choose Any Location Across the Globe</li><li>Use GPS Joystick to virtually collect all your favorite Pokemon GO characters</li><li>Customize the movement speed using a simple slider</li><li>Automatic marching to configure your character to move in one direction automatically</li><li>Control GPS location for up to 5 iOS devices simultaneously</li><li>Compatible with the latest iOS version</li></ul><p>So, if you are also ready to use the best PokeGo++ alternative, here’s the detailed step-by-step process to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>That’s it; when you’ll launch Pokemon Go, you’ll automatically notice different streets. At this point, you can enable “GPS Joystick” and easily control your movement without walking at all.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Despite being a pretty useful tweaked version of Pokemon Go, PokeGO++ is not available anymore. However, if you still want to catch different types of Pokemon in the game, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (iOS) to set a fake GPS location in the game. And, if you are an Android user, you can directly download any of the GPS Joystick apps on your smartphone and use it to manipulate the smartphone’s GPS location easily.</p><h2 id="How-to-Change-Your-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Max"><a href="#How-to-Change-Your-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Your Location on Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max"></a>How to Change Your Location on Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max</h2><p>There are several situations when you might have to change the location on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max.

Your smartphone, be it iPhone, Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your device’s location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.</p><p>When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where you’re connecting from.  This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but it’s probably to be somewhere between the city and the street you’re in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.</p><p>All we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to <strong>change location on Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max</strong>, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-break-the-geo-limitation-on-downloading-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?"></a>Part 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?</h2><p>Step 1: On your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, go to the App Store app.</p><p>Step 2: Click on the “Featured” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/featured-tab-app-store.jpg"                      alt="featured tab app store"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, scroll down to locate your Apple id and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/locate-apple-id-app-store.jpg"                      alt="locate apple id app store"                ></p><p>Step 4: Choose “View Apple ID”.

It’s basically a hacked IPA version of the original Pokemon Go that comes with a built-in joystick feature. You can use this feature to teleport your location to anywhere in the world and catch a wide variety of Pokemon without even walking a single step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokego++.jpg"                      alt="pokego++"                ></p><p>PokeGo++ was developed by the developers at Global++ to give users leverage and help them catch their favorite Pokemon characters easily. These developers reverse-engineered the original Pokemon Go code released by Niantic and designed their own version of the game, i.e., Poke Go++. With PokeGo++, you can set your smartphone’s GPS location instantly and find some of the rarest Pokemon characters to increase your XP.</p><p>It’s worth noting that PokeGo++ was released for both Android and iOS. Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max&#x2F;iPad users could use PokeGo++ via Cydia Impactor. On the other hand, PokeGo++ Android could be installed using Fly GPS.

Unfortunately, the answer is “No”, PokeGo++ is neither available for iOS nor Android. Back in 2019, when the majority of users started switching to PokeGo++, Niantic filed a lawsuit against Global++. They claimed that the hacked version of Pokemon Go gives an unfair advantage to some users. In addition to this, Niantic also stated that PokeGo++ was developed by infringing on Niantic’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>Due to this lawsuit, Global++ had to immediately stop the release of PokeGo++ to its users, take down their official website, and delete all their discord servers as well.
